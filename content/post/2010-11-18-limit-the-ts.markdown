title: It's Time to Limit the Power of the TSA

I fly a lot. It's an occupational necessity. When the TSA was first introduced after 9/11 I though it was a good idea to have stepped up and consistent security procedures at our airports. So after years of dealing with the TSA, I believe we now have a system that is clearly out of control.
We have all heard the TSA horror stories.  At first they were few and far between but now it seems like I hear of these transgressions on a weekly basis. The latest incident at [San Diego International Airport](http://johnnyedge.blogspot.com/2010/11/these-events-took-place-roughly-between.html) I find particularly distasteful and alarming.  Full body scanners? Invasive unwarranted search?  What's next?
The body scanners the TSA wants to deploy are slow, potentially harmful (especially for [frequent flyers](http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/11/16/travel.airport.security.measures/index.html)), and a violation of our rights. The TSA and other agencies say they can't and won't store those images, but there are [no guarantees](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40218074/ns/technology_and_science-security) those scanner images won't turn up on the Internet.
It's time to stop this madness. Start at [Fly with Dignity](http://flywithdignity.org/). Get involved. Get educated.  Then call you senator and congress person and ask them to take action.  It only takes a few minutes to register a policy concern and it does have an effect. I had an hour of my live back when a customer cancelled a conference call so I called my senators and my congressman. I was done in 15 minutes and that includes contacting my state legislators. Here in NJ we have a [local resolution](http://www.latimes.com/travel/sns-ap-us-travel-brief-nj-scanners-lawmakers,0,6503537.story) to send a signal to legislators at the national level to stop the deployment of these body scanners in our airports.
There has got to be a better way. Stepping up questioning at airports is probably a better idea.
