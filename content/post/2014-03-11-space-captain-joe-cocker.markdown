Oscar week came and went. While I don't pay much attention to these festivities, one particular nominee was hard to avoid.  Idina Menzel and "Let It Go" has to be one of the wickedest ear worms to arrive in recent memory. No question the girl has a set of pipes, but the sound is sickly sweet. Too perfect. It's even harder to avoid if you have any contact  with children under the age of 13. I needed a pick this week like a full on cleanse. Nothing like a little raspy Joe Cocker to scrub off that syrup. Here is one of my favorite tracks from Mad Dogs and Englishmen, "Space Captain".
