There is a running joke between analysts, statisticians, politicians, and other people that bend the truth with data that if you show any charts the trend lines should all move high and to the right. That signals a positive result. For me, in my struggle with Type II diabetes, charts that show trends down and to the right are much better.

The first is my weight. If anything it's the most impressive chart. It shows a decline from 282 to 249 over a period of 8 months. It hasn't been easy but I had pretty strong motivation. How did I do it? I've been on a low-carb diet and I've cranked up the exercise. I'm a pretty strong believer in the thermodynamic weight loss model.

The second chart is my blood glucose. It starts way up on the left at 382 and moves down and stabilizes around 100. The great thing about this chart is that my glucose numbers have been stable and I have been off the medication since Memorial day. Diet and exercise alone are working for me.[![](http://stevegio.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_2318.png?w=200)](http://stevegio.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_2318.png)
