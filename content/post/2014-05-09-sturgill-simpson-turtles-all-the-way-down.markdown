I'm not a big fan of country and western music. But when I came across Sturgill Simpson's "Turtles all the Way Down" I couldn't just toss it onto that heap of music reserved for cowboys crying in their beer. I mean how can you ignore a song with lyrics like:

There's a gateway in our mind that leads somewhere   
far beyond this plane,  
Where reptile aliens made of light open you up  
take out all your pain



Jesus, Buddha, the Devil, and a whole host of hallucinogens have been put in a blender, mixed with Jack, whipped into a froth and served up in a frosty mug in this song. Take a gulp and you'll get that hippy love aftertaste. I'll be waiting for the rest of the tracks from this album to hit Spotify. I hope y'all like it.
