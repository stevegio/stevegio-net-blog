Ever since it's introduction in iOS 6, the iOS Passbook has become an indispensable feature of my iPhone. At any given time it contains at a minimum 3-4 passes and at times I have as many as 10 items stored in Passbook. I put everything I can into Passbook. Airline and train tickets, museum and event passes, and store loyalty cards all get stored in one convenient place. I'm delighted when I interact with merchants that support Passbook and I try to avoid those that don't.
Using Passbook has eliminated having to print boarding and other travel related passes, which has probably saved me quite a bit of money on paper and ink jet cartridges over the last few years. Typical boarding passes print in color. The extra info junk printed on every airline boarding pass, even though the boarding pass doesn't take up one full sheet of US Letter sized paper, typically results in two sheets of paper are used for a single pass. All of it wasted. Not so if you are using Passbook.
Passbook even ensures that the right pass is available on the lock screen of my phone just when I need it.  This feature works great with travel or timed event related passes.  When it's time for me to hop on a train the train ticket is just there on my iPhone lock screen.  Because I travel a lot, this reduces travel stress and anxiety. Before I leave home I don't have to remember where stored my printed boarding pass ("_Is it in my bag or my jacket or on the printer?!?_") In boarding lines, I'm not fumbling around looking for the right ticket.
As someone involved in the business of software and technology, I like to think I'm making the world better and delighting customers with the work I do. I can wholeheartedly proclaim that Passbook has simplified and enhanced this small part of my life. I hope someone at Apple picks this up and forwards it to the team responsible for creating this magical feature of iOS. I'd like to let them know how great that product is and buy them a few beers.
