I've been in San Francisco all week and if the weather cooperates I'll be on my way home in a few hours. My pick for the week is "Smoke and Mirrors" by Widowspeak. This tune is a bit atypical of the bands more earnest slower tempo folk flavor. I had Widowspeak on heavy rotation as I walked through the Haight. This song came on when walking down from Buena Vista park. Such a nice park....
