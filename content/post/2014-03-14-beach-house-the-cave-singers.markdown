Posting "Beach House" by The Cave Singers this week. They are an earnest folk trio with bright voices (probably bright eyes) and a wonderful clean organic acoustic sound. It's a nice change from some of the other music currently in heavy rotation. I'm also sick of winter and dreaming of summer on Long Beach Island.
