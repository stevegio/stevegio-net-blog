<blockquote>...when normal people — not gadget bloggers and geeks like us — need to consider an alternative to the iPad, they’re not just thinking of Apple’s lack of “openness” (as Google so vaguely and poorly defines it in relation to Android) or the iPad’s lack of some individual hardware feature. Buying an alternative means giving up Apple’s entire ecosystem. That’s worth it to some buyers, but it’s incredibly impractical for many.</blockquote>



Interesting [post](http://www.marco.org/2546655554) from [Marco Arment](http://marco.org).  He may be right. A tablet probably can't be successful without the kind of support ecosystem and the seamless integration between hardware and software that Apple can provide.  My favorite part of the article is how he divides the tablet community along the lines of those that know what RSS is and those who do not.  Seems like a simple acid test.
