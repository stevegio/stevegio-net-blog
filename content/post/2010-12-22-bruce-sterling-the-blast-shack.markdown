I highly recommend those of you interested in the whole WikiLeaks kerfuffle to read Bruce Sterling's article [The Blast Shack](http://www.webstock.org.nz/blog/2010/the-blast-shack/). I think he's hit on some strange socio-political conservation law where the Internet and the New World Order are variables in an equation that is trying to balance out.  The problem is there are other terms in the equation that will be irrevocably cancelled and lost. A fairly down-beat assesment but very thought provoking.
