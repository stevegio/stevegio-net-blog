Dropping two tracks that had been on heavy rotation at the beach house this year. The first is a jam by the Swedish band Goat titled "Hide from the Sun". I love the heavily fuzzed out guitar line about 2/3 in to this one. The second is "Dawn of Time" by the San Diego reggae band Tribal Seeds. I know San Diego isn't normally the place I would go to seek out this kind of music but this track goes great with sand, surf, and sunshine.
