[Mike Lofgren, Goodbye to All That: Reflections of a GOP Operative Who Left the Cult](http://www.truth-out.org/goodbye-all-reflections-gop-operative-who-left-cult/1314907779)


<blockquote>An unemployed worker in a breadline in 1932 would have felt little gratitude to the Rockefellers or the Mellons. But that is not the case in the present economic crisis. After a riot of unbridled greed such as the world has not seen since the conquistadors' looting expeditions and after an unprecedented broad and rapid transfer of wealth upward by Wall Street and its corporate satellites, where is the popular anger directed, at least as depicted in the media? At "Washington spending" - which has increased primarily to provide unemployment compensation, food stamps and Medicaid to those economically damaged by the previous decade's corporate saturnalia.</blockquote>


Probably the central political mystery of our time.
