I didn't go to a ton of shows in 2013 but it's no question that the highlight was the Halloween Blood Bath in San Francisco with the Flaming Lips, Tame Impala, and White Denim. Since it was Halloween, I donned my "Oldest Geezer at the Rock Show" costume and boogied with all the youngsters on the floor. What an amazing show. The bands did not disappoint.

The Flaming Lips are not shy about breaking out a great cover now and again. When I saw them earlier in 2013 they produced a superb straight version of "Heroes". I gave me goose bumps. Â Halloween they managed to deliver a surprise cover of Devo's "Gates of Steel". Wayne Coyne dedicated it to Alan Meyers (who passed away that summer) and all the other freaks in the audience. It was a great tribute. The original is my pick for this week.
