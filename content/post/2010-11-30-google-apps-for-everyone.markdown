Going Google has now become a possibility for the individual. Google is in the early stages of making more of there services available to Google Apps accounts holders.  That means the differences between a standard Google account and a Google Apps account are being erased.  In the past services like Google Analytics, Adwords, Blogger, and Picasa could not be used by Google Apps account holders. If you wanted to use those services you had to use a standard, personal, Google Account. This makes the decision to create a Google Apps account for a "prosumer" a no brainer.  Why sign up for a personal account with a generic '@gmail.com' address when you can sign up for a Google Apps account with your own personal domain? It certainly boosts the stock value of a Google Apps account.
