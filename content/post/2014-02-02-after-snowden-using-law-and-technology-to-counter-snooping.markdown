Interesting video of a Council of Europe meeting on NSA mass surveillance. Big take-aways here:

0) While the situation we find ourselves is bleak it is not hopeless.

1) The mass surveillance perpetrated by the NSA and their international counterparts is unlawful and a violation of international civil rights.

2) We have to take an active role in protecting our own privacy by changing our own habits by using systems like Tor or GnuPG.  Free Software can help but it's not sufficient.

3) Technology isn't enough. Laws must change.
