<blockquote>I belong to a music sharing group where each week we post a new track with some bits of commentary. Mainly its just a way for some like minded folks to discover new music.  I've decided to cross post my picks for the week here so that I can shared them with the world and preserve a copy for myself on a service that isn't owned by a "rich creep" (more on that reference later). Anyhoo, I hope you enjoy the weekly music post. Thanks. -- The Management.</blockquote>



I'm a huge Foxygen fan. My pick this week is a band formed by their drummer Shaun Flemming. Recording under the name Diane Coffee, "My Friend Fish" is a delight for those of you who can't get enough Foxygen. This album is tasty. I've starred at least 4 tracks and it's hard to pick a favorite among favorites. If you put a gun to my head, ["Tale Of A Dead Dog"](http://open.spotify.com/track/2PLktgIgyPlGzo26ngdWyB) is a sweet cut that tips it's hat in the direction of some prog rock forebears. Hope you like it.
