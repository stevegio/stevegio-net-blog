About four years ago I was sitting in the All Star Sandwich Bar inÂ Cambridge, MA eating an Atomic Meatloaf Meltdown and drinking a Harpoon Ale. I was alone so I picked up a local music trade paper and was leafing through it when I stumbled upon a review for the album "i" by MMOSS a psychedelic jam band from New Hampshire. I was intrigued. After finishing my meal I went out an bought the CD somewhere near Harvard Square and I've been a fan ever since.
I'm pretty sure they have only recently been available on Spotify and it looks like a re-issue of "i" is available. My pick for the week is "Hedge Creeper". It's a short fun jam full of late 60s AM radio tropes. I think Ron Burgundy is playing lead jazz flute on this one. Enjoy this track while driving with the top down.
