I hope that thought went through everyone's mind when Google launched [Keep](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep). It certainly was on [James Fallows' mind](http://boingboing.net/2013/03/21/james-fallows-doesnt-trust-g.html) when he saw the announcement.  The name of this product must seem like a cruel joke to [Reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html) users. What incentive do they have to keep any of their free (or even paid) products running?  The free products don't bring in any revenue and what they consider strategic today may not be tomorrow.

A better proposition for end users is to depend on paid products from a smaller company that wants to build a sustainable business. Beware of free. Why invest in Keep when [Evernote](http://evernote.com) exists?
