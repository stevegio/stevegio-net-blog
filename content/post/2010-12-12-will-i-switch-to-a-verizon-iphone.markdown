A lot of people have been asking me if I will switch when the iPhone is available on the Verizon Wireless network. The short answer: Probably not. Here is my thinking.
First, I'm assuming there is a huge pent-up demand for the iPhone on Verizon.  That will consist of existing Verizon customer and a slew of disgruntled AT&T customers who have been itching to switch because of AT&T's less than stellar network.  This is going to mean a ton of new subscribers hitting the Verizon network with data hungry iPhones.  I have a feeling Verizon's cellular network will bend and probably break under the strain. So the Verizon network might get worse for the first few quarters while it's under rapid expansion of subscribers and the load on the network increases.  There hasn't been a CDMA version of the iPhone so we are not sure how it will behave on that network. The result may be a poor network experience for all those new switchers.
Second, I have to buy a new phone. My existing iPhone won't work on the Verizon network so I'll have to buy a new phone and new plan with Verizon.  Which means I'll have to cover two plans at once.  Just to switch to Verizon. Not terrible but not ideal.
Finally, I remember all the issues that AT&T had with activations when they first launched the iPhone a few years ago.  We don't know the details but there were a lot of processes between Apple and AT&T that weren't fully baked and tested.  The first few months were a bit rough for users with activation problems.  Apple can certainly bring a ton of experience to bear but Verizon is new to the iPhone. I anticipate glitches in the Apple/Verizon backend system integration that might cause issues for new switchers.
So I'm going to uncharacteristically sit on the sidelines for this launch. I have been happier with AT&T service over the past 6 months.  It seems to be getting better, although I haven't traveled to Mountain View lately.  It's been working very well in the NYC Metro area. Who knows.  Maybe all those folks fleeing AT&T just might give us some more bandwidth and improve quality of service for those of us left behind on AT&T.
