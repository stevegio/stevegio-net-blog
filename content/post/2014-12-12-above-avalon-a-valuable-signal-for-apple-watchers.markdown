I do a lot of apple watching and over time I've whittled down the number of places I go for such information. Recently Neil Cybart (a former stock analyst) launched [Above Avalon](http://www.aboveavalon.com) a throwback email newsletter that covers Apple from a finance angle. I normally would have unsubscribed by now, who needs more email, but Cybart has me hooked. Just today he introduced me to a few new companies with apps in a growing space aimed at the financial consumers: [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com), [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com), and [Oscar](https://www.hioscar.com). (Robinhood sounds particularly interesting to me.) Short and to the point, I look forward to reading Above Avalon every weekday. I recommend it to anyone interested in news related to Apple as a business.
