I'm just getting around to listening to Woods April release "With Light and With Love". I like what I hear. My pick for the week is the title track. It kicks off with a McGuinn-esque guitar riff that weaves it's way through the various structures the band has erected in this song. I'll ask for forgiveness in advance. It's a bit long but it is complex enough to hold my interest through the full 9:07. Another less lengthy track which I also dig is "Moving to the Left". I can't wait to hear more from the band. I've been a fan since their 2011 release "Sun and Shade". Enjoy!
