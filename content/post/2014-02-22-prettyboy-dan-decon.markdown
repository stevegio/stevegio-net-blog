I've been going on a bit of a Pavement tear lately but broke out of it long enough to visit some other lesser known artists in my messy Spotify playlists. (Spotify really needs to fix this.) Anyway, one artist I dabbled with was Dan Deacon.Â  Deacon is an electronic composer/musician currently based in Baltimore. The track I'm selecting this week is "Prettyboy" from the album "America". I love this track. It's a combination of rich circular sythns, injected with what sounds like analog percussion, sprinkled with bubbling oboes. It's one of those soundtrack pieces you imagine being used in the movie of your life.
