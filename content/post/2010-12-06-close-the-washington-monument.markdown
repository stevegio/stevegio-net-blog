Another great article on how terrorism is psychological warfare and how the US has taken the bait.

[Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com) -- [Close the Washington Monument](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/12/close_the_washi.html)


<blockquote>Terrorism isn't a crime against people or property. It's a crime against our minds, using the death of innocents and destruction of property to make us fearful. Terrorists use the media to magnify their actions and further spread fear. And when we react out of fear, when we change our policy to make our country less open, the terrorists succeed -- even if their attacks fail. But when we refuse to be terrorized, when we're indomitable in the face of terror, the terrorists fail -- even if their attacks succeed.</blockquote>
