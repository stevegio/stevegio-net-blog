New Parquet Courts just hit Spotify this week. "Sunbathing Animal" is a rollicking punk punch in the nose. It's also the title track from their new release due soon. Can't wait. These guys are one of my favorite new bands of 2013. "Master Of My Craft" into "Borrowed Time" on Light Up Gold is my new "Scarlet-Fire" and it's only 5 minutes 32 seconds!
