Mogwai have just dropped a new sythn soaked album "Rave Tapes". Quite a departure for the Scottish post-rock band. I like it a lot. "Simon Ferocious" is one of my favorite tracks. It pushes the syths right up front but supports them with some great electric guitar work more typical of the bands signature sound.
