To borrow a phrase from Frank Zappa: folk-rock is not dead, it just smells funny. This was the first thought that entered my mind when I started listening to Wolf People late in 2013. Their new album "Fain" is a mix of blues, folk, and mild psychedelia that reminds me most of Jethro Tull. My pick for the week is "When the Fire is Dead in the Grate". Yeah I know this has been done before but I'm sick this week and this music is like chicken soup.
