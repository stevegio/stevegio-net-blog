<blockquote>"Officially, Google declared that “sharing is broken on the web”...As it turned out, sharing was not broken. Sharing was working fine and dandy..." -- [James Whittaker](http://blogs.msdn.com/415656/ProfileUrlRedirect.ashx) ["Why I left Google"](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx)</blockquote>


Whittaker's exit post is an interesting look into one person's take on what's going on at Google right now. The few lines above really struck a chord with me. Whittaker goes on to state that sharing is happening a lot, mostly on Facebook, which is true but it doesn't have to be that way. Yes, it's easy to share on Facebook (maybe too easy) but starting a blog and publishing on your own site isn't that much more difficult. Discovery isn't a problem either since Google search indexes everything and if you want notifications services like Twitter, or better still [App.net](http://join.app.net), can replace the wall/activity stream of content gulags like Facebook and Google+.

Whittaker quotes his daughter as saying "social isn't a product...social is _people_ and the people are on Facebook." Quite true. But the people are also all on the Internet and it's full of great ways to connect and share that don't involve turning your life over to one company. It might be easier but why give them all the power? Because everyone is there?
