If you are only going to read one article on the TSA, please read this one. 

[How our "security" obsession costs us](http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2010/11/30/oversized_security_hurts_america/index.html)


<blockquote>"The terrorists never have to strike an actual target. It's not even incumbent upon them to build a bomb that works. Just about anything will do. To be successful, they just have to repeatedly send things in our direction, inciting the expectable Pavlovian reaction from the U.S. national security state, causing it to further tighten its grip (grope?) at yet greater taxpayer expense."</blockquote>
