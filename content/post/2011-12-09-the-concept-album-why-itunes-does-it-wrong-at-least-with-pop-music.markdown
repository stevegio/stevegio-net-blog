I downloaded [Genesis' "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L63JC8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=giolist-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001L63JC8) this week from Amazon. It's an amazing album and yes on Amazon you have to buy all of it's 23 glorious, prog rock tracks. I would have preferred to buy this from iTunes but I think the reason that album isn't there is because it is a complete musical work and except for a few selections of classical music I don't see any pop albums being sold as complete "album only" purchases.  Meaning you can't just buy one track, you need to buy the complete work. I know to most of you this notion of a album or CD being packaged as a complete musical work is an anachronism but I disagree.

Most pop music artist today can't produce 10 or 20 tracks of awesome.  Most musicians create one or two hits, package that with 10 or so mediocre songs, and push that out as their latest release. When all you could by was physical media, you got stuck buying vinyl or a CD just to get the one or two good tracks. iTunes (and other music stores) were designed to defend us from that crappy tactic by allowing us to buy music by the track. But there are some albums that are complete works and I'm not just talking about "Dark Side of the Moon"
