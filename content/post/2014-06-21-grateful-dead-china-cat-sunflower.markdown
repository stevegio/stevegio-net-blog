June 20th was the 45th anniversary of the 1969 release of "Aoxomoxoa" by the Grateful Dead. It's hard to pick just one track. It's like picking your favorite son or daughter. Since I can't post all eight original tracks I'll pick "China Cat Sunflower" a classic Garcia/Hunter psychedelic collaboration.
