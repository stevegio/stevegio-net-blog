Black Moth Super Rainbow member, Tobacco dropped a new album "Ultima II Massage" a few weeks ago and my pick for the week is "Eruption (Gonna Get My Hair Cut at the End of The Summer)". I really like BMSR and Tobacco seems like he's a major component of their sound. I especially dig some of the more throbbing-spacy-wavy tracks. The [video](http://vimeo.com/91776291)Â for "Streaker", directed by Eric Wareheim, is NSFW and pretty disturbing. Watch it with the lights on.
