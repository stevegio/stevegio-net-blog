Posting "Rattlesnake" by St. Vincent from a self titled album that dropped late last year. Â St. Vincent (aka Annie Erin Clark) has had an interesting career so far. She's been a member of Polyphonic Spree and performed with Sufjan Stevens, The Mountain Goats, and David Byrne. "Digital Witness" has been making the rounds on commercial radio and you should definitely check it out. "Rattlesnake" written after her walk through the Texas hill country (sans clothing) was interrupted by an actual rattlesnake.
