				"content_html": "<p>I can‚Äôt believe an entire year has passed since I upgraded to iPhone 7 plus. I love my iPhone and the plus form factor. My initial reason for going <strong>plus</strong> was to get the better camera features, it is after all my primary camera, but I found myself actually enjoying having the larger screen.\nWhile the iPhone 7 plus was an improvement over my iPhone 6 plus in almost every way it wasn‚Äôt a big leap in technology. That big leap in technology arrived today in the form of the iPhone X.</p>\n\n<h2>Unboxing</h2>\n\n<p>The most remarkable moment unboxing the phone is when you see the screen for the first time. It‚Äôs amazing how much it reminds me of the iPhone 3g and 3 gs. The chrome band around the face, the rounded corners are really striking after staring at the 7 plus front face for over a year and previous generations for ten.\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-605\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/390/2025/3e771d01c6.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\">\nThe lack of a home button also takes you aback. How are you going to unlock and work the damn thing? It brought the realization that I was going to have to learn a few gestures before I could even use this new phone.\nGetting the phone out of the box revealed the usual iPhone accessories. The usual charging block, USB-Lightning cable, wired ear buds, and headphone jack dongle are all under the phone.</p>\n\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>In anticipation of getting the X, I started off the day making an encrypted backup on my laptop. I want all my settings and health data restored on the new phone so an encrypted back is the only way to transfer them to the new phone. Prior to the backup iTunes reminded me to install iOS 11 which I did assuming the iPhone X would come pre-installed with it.\nThe new install process is very slick. Just put the phone next to another iOS device, enter your phone unlock pin, and the initial critical settings are transferred. The Face ID registration was very fast, probably less than a minute. Activation on the cellular network failed the first time but worked fine on the first retry. The last step asked me if I wanted to set the X up as a new phone or restore from iCloud or iTunes backup. I picked iTunes and connected the phone to my laptop. Then iTunes threw up a warning that my phone was running an older version of iOS and I would have to update the phone. (Airhorns)\nThe upgrade took agonizingly long. I was getting antsy. I tried not to freak out when I saw the estimated time start at 2 hours, drop to 40 minutes, and then start counting down at 20 minutes. The actual upgrade took around 30-40 minutes. When it was done, I was able to get the backup restored to the phone and I was in. Here are some quick notes on my experience.</p>\n\n<h2>Size</h2>\n\n<p>After being in the ‚ÄúPlus Club‚Äù for so long this phone feels tiny in my hands. It feels small and as when holding other non-plus phones it should feel disappointing because of the non-plus screen size but not with this iPhone. The screen goes out to the edges. It looks so large in comparison to how it feels. It‚Äôs like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS\">Tardis</a> of iPhones.</p>\n\n<h2>True Tone</h2>\n\n<p>This is the first device I own with True Tone and I don‚Äôt think I want another device without True Tone. The color of this display is stunning. There were some times when I felt like I was looking at a printed page. It‚Äôs like looking at a Retina display for the first time. You never want to look at a non-retina display ever again.</p>\n\n<h2>The Notch</h2>\n\n<p>I thought I would hate it. It‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt <strong>hate</strong> it. But you stop noticing in in portrait mode. The same can not be said when you rotate the phone on it‚Äôs side. That black notch in my beautiful screen is <strong>very</strong> noticeable when you hold the phone in landscape. We are all going to need to get use to this new <strong>feature</strong> of our phones.</p>\n\n<h2>Face ID</h2>\n\n<p>Face ID works great and works best when you don‚Äôt think about it. During my first few minutes with the phone I did have a couple of misfires. One because of the angle of my phone (almost pointed away from my face) and the other because I flubbed the unlock gesture. After two to three minutes you just get used to it. Everything gets smoother when you just start to <strong>expect</strong> that it works. The new unlock gesture is that easy to learn.\nLater when I jumped in my car, Face ID worked fine with my sun glasses on and the phone at a low angle/position relative to my face. I thought for sure it wouldn‚Äôt work 100% of the time but sure enough it was reliable.</p>\n\n<h2>Speed</h2>\n\n<p>This phone is fast. It‚Äôs noticeably faster than my 7 plus.</p>\n\n<h2>Feelings After One Day</h2>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs not a minor incremental improvement. It‚Äôs a leap forward. It‚Äôs a blast to learn the new features, some so fundamental to the operation of the device.\nVery happy with this phone. Glad I upgraded.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I woke up in a hotel room in Cleveland Ohio yesterday morning. Mid way through my morning routine I discovered my iPad 3 was missing. It wasn't in my bag but it only took a fraction of second for me to realize where it was. The night before I had flown to Cleveland from Chicago on a late flight. Minutes before I had dozed off I had placed the iPad in the seat back pocket in front of me. ¬†It happened to me once before but in that case someone from the airline called me thirty or so minutes after I left the airport to tell me I left it behind. ¬†I received no such call this time.</p><p>I had configured the \"Find My Device\" feature of iCloud on this iPad which has helped me locate it a few times when I've misplaced it or left it at the office. ¬†So I thought I would just login to iCloud and see if my iPad was at the airport locked up in some lost and found cabinet with dozens of other similar devices, scarves, gloves, pens, sunglasses, etc. I was flying back home that night so I figured I could just pick it up on my way out of Cleveland. I clicked on the link to show the map with the location of my iPad. There it was indicated on the map as a bright green dot but it wasn't at the airport. <em>Crap.</em> It was at a residential address in a suburb of Cleveland, a bad suburb of Cleveland. <em>Shit!¬†</em>It looks like someone involved with turning that airplane around last night decided to take it home.</p><p>I called the airline. ¬†Explained the situation. ¬†I filed a missing property report. Gave them the current location of my iPad. While they were sympathetic they advised me to call the Cleveland police. At that point a bunch of thoughts entered my mind. ¬†<em>Maybe the person brought it home because lost and found was closed? ¬†Maybe they were going to bring it back to the airport when their shift started again? If I get the cops involved would I be making someone's already difficult life way more difficult?</em>¬†<em>Damn it! Who's dumb enough to steal an iOS device and leave it on!¬†</em>Since my iPad had a lock screen the person who took it couldn't just get in and wipe it.¬†I decided to use the \"Lost Mode\" which allows you to send a message to the device. I wrote, \"Hi, I want my iPad back. I won't press charges.\" and I included my phone number. ¬†Within minutes someone shut the device off. ¬†The green dot on the map turned into a grey one.</p><p>I called the police and filed a report. They asked me all the details. They also took the address that I had obtained from iCloud. The officer who took the report mentioned that this has happened before and they didn't have any luck getting the device back. He said he would get back to me. I felt bad involving the police. They probably had way more important stuff to deal with than this kind of petty crime. ¬†But they took all the information and said they would follow up. ¬†I thought that would be the last I would ever talk to them again.</p><p>I was in town with one of my account execs to meet with a customer so I was in meetings most of the day. It was in the back of my mind the whole time.</p><p>About an hour later, during a customer meeting, my phone rang. It was a Cleveland number. ¬†Since I was with the client I let it go to voicemail. During a break I called the number back. ¬†The person who owned the phone had set up a \"ring back tone\" which is basically a song that plays instead of the normal ringing sound. ¬†The song the person set up was the theme song from Hawaii Five-O by The Ventures. I laughed out loud because I had a pretty good idea this was the number of an officer from the Cleveland PD. ¬†Turns out I was correct. ¬†After he picked up my call, he said they had looked up the address, talked to the airline, and confirmed that a cleaning contractor lived at that address. He said he didn't have a warrant or anything but he was going to go over and \"knock on the door\" and call me when he knew anything. ¬†My hopes of getting my iPad back were lifting at the same time my thoughts about the person who took it were sinking. They were in deep do-do. ¬†At this point even if they brought it back to the airport lost and found the airline and the police knew they had walked off with it. ¬†This person was going to lose a job over this at a minimum.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later my phone rang again. I couldn't take the call so I called back when we got to a break in the customer meeting. ¬†I called back, listened to the the Hawaii Five-O theme, and then the CPD officer picked up. He said he had no luck getting anyone to answer the door but he had a feeling someone was in the house. ¬†They probably knew they were in trouble. ¬†He said he would try again later. I went back to my meeting.</p><p>Our meeting with the customer was over and we had a lot of time to kill before our flights home, so we decided to take a quick tour of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ¬†As we were buying the tickets I noticed I missed a call. ¬†It was the CPD officer. ¬†I called his number back, listened to the Hawaii Five-O theme, and the officer picked up. He told me he had recovered the iPad from the person who stole it. I was blown away. ¬†I thanked him profusely. He told me he was going to drop it off with the CPD at the airport. I would need to fill out some paperwork but I could pick it up on my way out of Cleveland.</p><p>I consider myself lucky. This wasn't a cheap iPad. It was a 64GB model with wifi and cellular. ¬†It would not have been cheap to replace. ¬†I did have iCloud \"Find My iPad\" turned on but a more competent thief would have turn the device off, making it impossible to locate, and just DFU restored the device back to factory settings. (iOS 7 would have eliminated that but I did not upgrade that device. It was still running iOS 6.) Finally, the CPD did a great job connecting the dots and retrieving the device. I am very grateful. ¬†As for the person that took it, they have probably lost their job over this. I feel bad but taking that iPad was dumb. It would have been so much easier to have done the right thing. Hopefully they won't do it again.</p><p>Oh... one other odd thing happened.

At any given time it contains at a minimum 3-4 passes and at times I have as many as 10 items stored in Passbook. I put everything I can into Passbook. Airline and train tickets, museum and event passes, and store loyalty cards all get stored in one convenient place. I&rsquo;m delighted when I interact with merchants that support Passbook and I try to avoid those that don&rsquo;t.\nUsing Passbook has eliminated having to print boarding and other travel related passes, which has probably saved me quite a bit of money on paper and ink jet cartridges over the last few years. Typical boarding passes print in color. The extra info junk printed on every airline boarding pass, even though the boarding pass doesn&rsquo;t take up one full sheet of US Letter sized paper, typically results in two sheets of paper are used for a single pass. All of it wasted. Not so if you are using Passbook.\nPassbook even ensures that the right pass is available on the lock screen of my phone just when I need it.  This feature works great with travel or timed event related passes.  When it&rsquo;s time for me to hop on a train the train ticket is just there on my iPhone lock screen.  Because I travel a lot, this reduces travel stress and anxiety. Before I leave home I don&rsquo;t have to remember where stored my printed boarding pass (&rdquo;<em>Is it in my bag or my jacket or on the printer?!?</em>&rdquo;) In boarding lines, I&rsquo;m not fumbling around looking for the right ticket.\nAs someone involved in the business of software and technology, I like to think I&rsquo;m making the world better and delighting customers with the work I do. I can wholeheartedly proclaim that Passbook has simplified and enhanced this small part of my life. I hope someone at Apple picks this up and forwards it to the team responsible for creating this magical feature of iOS. I&rsquo;d like to let them know how great that product is and buy them a few beers.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I have to admit my <a href=\"http://stevegio.net/2012/07/08/282-384/\" title=\"Type 2 Diabetes\">Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis</a> had not surprised me. I was in denial about my weight, lack of exercise, and poor diet. Once I got the news, I didn‚Äôt sit around feeling bad about it. I sprung into action. It was as if I gained a few extra points of IQ, recognized my exact position, and made an immediate resolution to beat it. I surprised myself.</p>\n<p>The plan was simple. Lose the weight by altering my diet and starting an exercise program. By getting my weight under control, I might get my body‚Äôs systems back in balance, and reverse the diabetes. I wanted to take a data driven approach to everything I was doing. I wanted to watch the variables and measure results. I also believed seeing the results, viewing the data, would keep me motivated. If you can‚Äôt measure a system, you can‚Äôt improve it.</p>\n<p>In those few days after my diagnosis I set a weight goal. Given my height and build I should be somewhere between 180 and 220 lbs. So I needed to lose about 50 lbs, a big goal. I had decided that reducing carbs and getting more proteins, an Atkins like diet, would work for me. I had had some success with it in the past, now I had a good incentive to do it right this time.\nMy weight was the big variable and tracking it would be critical. You can screw up a low carb diet and actually gain weight. Measuring my weight every day would help me fine tune what I was eating. I wanted this data capture to be very simple, so I ended up buying a <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/build-links/individual/simple-get-html.html?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B002JE2PSA&amp;assoc_ss_ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB002JE2PSA%3Fie%3DUTF8%26keywords%3DWhithings%26qid%3D1341780827%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1%26sr%3D8-1&amp;parentASIN=B004K28IEE\" title=\"Whithings Body Scale\">Whithings Body Scale</a>. Data capture is automatic. You weigh yourself and the scale updates your data over WiFi on the Withings site. You can view the data on their web site or with a free iPhone app. It‚Äôs pricy but it simplifies and makes weigh-ins more fun.</p>\n<p>The second part of the plan was to get moving again. I did enjoy running in the past but though the easiest thing to do was to start walking. I set aside time every day to walk. The calories I would burn in conjunction with the low carb diet would help me take off the weight. I thought eventually I would start running again as the weight came off. For tracking my exercise and calories burned I chose <a href=\"http://runkeeper.com\" title=\"RunKeeper\">RunKeeper</a> on the iPhone. I love this app. Again it makes data collection, tracks all aspects of my workout, and keeps me motivated by alerting me to personal bests like ‚ÄúMost Activities in a Week‚Äù or ‚ÄúLongest Distance in an Activity‚Äù.\nFor testing and tracking blood glucose I‚Äôm using a <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/build-links/individual/simple-get-html.html?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B004DJ9208&amp;assoc_ss_ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB004DJ9208%3Fie%3DUTF8%26keywords%3DContour%2520blood%2520glucose%2520monitor%26qid%3D1341781125%26ref_%3Dsr_1_19%26s%3Dhpc%26sr%3D1-19&amp;parentASIN=B004DJ9208\" title=\"Contour Blood Glucose Meter\">Contour Blood Glucose Meter</a> and the <a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=WH3I6oZpD1M&amp;offerid=146261.353118307&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0\">BGluMon - Blood Glucose Monitor</a><img border=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=WH3I6oZpD1M&amp;bids=146261.353118307&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0\"> iPhone app. This part of my toolset isn‚Äôt so automated but it is simple. The Contour unit it pretty easy to run although it does  take some time to getting use to jabbing yourself for blood, but these new monitors require so little blood. (A tip from my doc: stop sticking your fingers. You can get all the blood you need from the outside edge of your palm.) BGluMon is also pretty simple to use and it was the easiest most helpful app I could find to run stats on my blood glucose readings. I‚Äôve shown the graphs it generates of my numbers to my doc during visits.  Very handy.</p>\n<p>The one big variable I‚Äôm not tracking closely is my calorie intake. I can‚Äôt seem to find a tool that will help me do this with minimal fuss. My rational here is that if I can keep the carbs out of my diet and if I can keep my meal sizes down, I won‚Äôt need to sweat the calories in count. I‚Äôd like to fix this eventually.</p>\n",

I wanted this data capture to be very simple, so I ended up buying a <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/build-links/individual/simple-get-html.html?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B002JE2PSA&amp;assoc_ss_ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB002JE2PSA%3Fie%3DUTF8%26keywords%3DWhithings%26qid%3D1341780827%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1%26sr%3D8-1&amp;parentASIN=B004K28IEE\" title=\"Whithings Body Scale\">Whithings Body Scale</a>. Data capture is automatic. You weigh yourself and the scale updates your data over WiFi on the Withings site. You can view the data on their web site or with a free iPhone app. It‚Äôs pricy but it simplifies and makes weigh-ins more fun.</p>\n<p>The second part of the plan was to get moving again. I did enjoy running in the past but though the easiest thing to do was to start walking. I set aside time every day to walk. The calories I would burn in conjunction with the low carb diet would help me take off the weight. I thought eventually I would start running again as the weight came off. For tracking my exercise and calories burned I chose <a href=\"http://runkeeper.com\" title=\"RunKeeper\">RunKeeper</a> on the iPhone. I love this app. Again it makes data collection, tracks all aspects of my workout, and keeps me motivated by alerting me to personal bests like ‚ÄúMost Activities in a Week‚Äù or ‚ÄúLongest Distance in an Activity‚Äù.\nFor testing and tracking blood glucose I‚Äôm using a <a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/build-links/individual/simple-get-html.html?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B004DJ9208&amp;assoc_ss_ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB004DJ9208%3Fie%3DUTF8%26keywords%3DContour%2520blood%2520glucose%2520monitor%26qid%3D1341781125%26ref_%3Dsr_1_19%26s%3Dhpc%26sr%3D1-19&amp;parentASIN=B004DJ9208\" title=\"Contour Blood Glucose Meter\">Contour Blood Glucose Meter</a> and the <a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=WH3I6oZpD1M&amp;offerid=146261.353118307&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0\">BGluMon - Blood Glucose Monitor</a><img border=\"0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=WH3I6oZpD1M&amp;bids=146261.353118307&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0\"> iPhone app. This part of my toolset isn‚Äôt so automated but it is simple. The Contour unit it pretty easy to run although it does  take some time to getting use to jabbing yourself for blood, but these new monitors require so little blood. (A tip from my doc: stop sticking your fingers. You can get all the blood you need from the outside edge of your palm.) BGluMon is also pretty simple to use and it was the easiest most helpful app I could find to run stats on my blood glucose readings. I‚Äôve shown the graphs it generates of my numbers to my doc during visits.  Very handy.</p>\n<p>The one big variable I‚Äôm not tracking closely is my calorie intake. I can‚Äôt seem to find a tool that will help me do this with minimal fuss. My rational here is that if I can keep the carbs out of my diet and if I can keep my meal sizes down, I won‚Äôt need to sweat the calories in count. I‚Äôd like to fix this eventually.</p>\n",

It was so bad I was having trouble reading street signs while driving. Degrading vision isn&rsquo;t uncommon in 40-somethings so naturally I just needed glasses.

I was on the road getting little or no exercise. My diet consisted of fast food and big nighttime meals with clients. I had ballooned to 282lbs.

We knew this would mean big changes but the lifestyle modification (better diet/more exercise) wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing. Still I think I stayed home the rest of the day, sitting on my comfy chair, expecting to literally explode or something. It&rsquo;s funny. I had had periods of &ldquo;healthy living&rdquo; in my life but I had always fallen off that wagon. People always warned me this day would come. It was a wakeup call.

				"content_html": "<p>When the first plane hit we only noticed the lights flickering and the chirping of the power supplies attached to our computers. A few minutes later the phone calls started coming in from family. Something hit one of the trade center towers. I was on the phone with my wife listening to her telling me to leave the city and come home, when the second plane flew past our building and crashed into the second tower. This time we all heard the plane hit and we felt the blast.\nI went out into the street to see what was happening. I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for what I saw. Both towers on fire, paper and other debris was raining down from the damaged floors above. My first instinct was to run to the site. I had friends there in those buildings and I wanted to lend a hand. My heart was pumping and I felt numb. The only thought in my head was to help. Get to the towers and help. People I passed were in shock. Some were crying. Sirens were screaming everywhere. A woman fainted her friends caught her. I didn&rsquo;t understand why, what did she see? When I got a block away from the south tower entrance I saw a police officer. He was directing traffic and people away from the area. I asked him where the people in the building who were evacuated being taken. He didn&rsquo;t know. I asked him how I can help. He couldn&rsquo;t say because he didn&rsquo;t know. I looked up and for the first time I saw people falling from the buildings. It was like time stopped. I had never seen anyone die before now I was watching, helpless, as many people were losing their lives violently at their own hands or in the fire raging 80 stories over my head.\nAt that instant I was enraged and impotent. I wasn&rsquo;t ready for this. There was something horrible happening that was out of control and no matter what I did there was nothing I could do to make things better. Then I looked back at the police officer and he said the best thing I could do would be to go home to my family. I walked/ran back to my building. I went back upstairs to the 7th floor. I called my wife to tell her I was safe and that I was going to try to make it to the Staten Island Ferry and leave the city from the south. I started to get off the phone with her when I heard her say, &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening&hellip;.&rdquo;. I felt our building shaking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming home. I&rsquo;ll be OK. I&rsquo;ll get in touch soon.&rdquo;, I told her just as the phones went dead and the power went out. I walked out into the hall.\nI knew the elevators would be down so I made my way to the stairs. I opened the door to the stairway and it was pitch black. There were no emergency lights. Feeling my way down and trying to count the floors as I went, I started down from the seventh floor. As I got down to about what I had estimated to be the second floor, I met three other people who were making their way down. Thankfully they had flashlights. The doors weren&rsquo;t marked but we got to the bottom of the stairway and opened the door out to what we hoped would be the lobby. We stepped out into the room and it was still dark.\n&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re in the basement?&rdquo;, one person said. I noticed the marble on the walls.\n&ldquo;No.&rdquo;, I said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the lobby.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Why is it so dark?, another person asked.\nThen I heard someone shouting, &ldquo;Help us!&rdquo;. I spun around. Where was that coming from?\n&ldquo;Help us!&rdquo;, I heard again.\nThis time someone came around a corner. It was a black woman. Maybe a police officer. I couldn&rsquo;t tell she was completely covered in dust. She was having difficulty breathing. It was in her eyes.\n&ldquo;Water!&rdquo;, someone called behind her.There were people streaming in from the street.\nThey were also covered in dust.\n&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;, I asked.\nAnother police officer passed by and said, &ldquo;The tower fell.&rdquo;\nJust then a janitor came from behind us in the hall way. The second officer asked him where we could get water. He fumbled for his keys and opened up one of the ground floor offices. There was a small kitchen in there. The few of us who were not choking were helping people into the kitchen, getting their eyes and throats clear, and helping the people who were coming in from the street. A person in a wheelchair, a woman with a baby, a British film crew. When things stabilized I opened an office door that faced West Street. I looked out the window and saw the entire street, as far as I could see covered with grey dust. A few people were stumbling, half/running, down the street. I banged on the window trying to signal them to go to the front of our building. Someone walked in to the office with a handheld camera. He was looking at the video he shot only moments ago as the tower collapsed. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes. By then people were talking about this as an attack. Quick rumors were circulating about more planes in the air. Someone said the Pentagon had been hit and the White House. As I turned away from the video and walked back to the window a police officer burst into the office and shouted,&ldquo;Everyone away from the windows! The second one is coming down!&rdquo;\nWe all ran out of the office and back into the hall. I felt a shudder, like a small earthquake. When it stopped I ran back to the office and looked out the window. I couldn&rsquo;t see anything. Just brown/grey dust blocking out the sun. I decided as soon as this dust settled enough that I would try to make it to the ferry. I walked back to the office with the kitchen. I grabbed an empty water bottle, filled it from the tap, and put it into my bag. I found some coffee filters and wet them down. They would do as dust masks if the dust didn&rsquo;t clear completely.I walked to the lobby entrance. The dust still choked the streets and I could almost make out the trees in Battery Park only a hundred feet away. Someone had a radio and was listening to the confused reporting in those first few hours. The Pentagon had been hit but not the White House. There were still planes unaccounted for but no other buildings have been hit. It was definitely a terrorist attack. Cell phones were useless. No one could make any calls. Someone walked outside to smoke a cigarette. They walked outside into that terrible cloud to smoke.\nA few minutes later the dust settled some more. I decided to leave. I walked outside. There were no sirens I could hear. It was strangely quiet. I walked down into Battery Park. A merciful wind was keeping the western side of the park closest to the the water free from smoke. People were congregating into this small oasis of clean air. A police officer announced that they were going to try to evacuate people from this area by boat. The injured would go first. So I decided to wait. As I was waiting my cell phone rang. It was a colleague. She asked if I was OK. I told her I was fine and if she could call my wife to let her know where I was and that I was safe. She said she would and we hung up. I tried to make an outbound call but I couldn&rsquo;t get a signal. At least my wife would know I was safe. I waited a few more minutes and tried the phone again. This time I got though to my home. I told my wife my situation and bits and pieces of what happened. I told her how I was getting out. I told her I loved her. People from the crowd started asking me to use my phone. I was afraid if I hung up I wouldn&rsquo;t get another signal so I asked people to give me their names and the phone numbers they wanted to call. I relayed them to my wife and we got messages to about a dozen families, including two NYC Firemen who had just escaped the tower&rsquo;s collapse.Finally some tug boats pulled up to the seawall. One by one they loaded up people who were waiting in Battery Park and they took us over to Liberty State Park in New Jersey. During the short ride across the bay no one spoke. We all just looked back in horror and grief at the spot where the World Trade Center had been standing and was now burning ash.</p>\n\n<p><em>Originally published on <a href=\"http://giolist.com/2002/09/my-911-story.html\">giolist.com</a></em></p>\n",

People were congregating into this small oasis of clean air. A police officer announced that they were going to try to evacuate people from this area by boat. The injured would go first. So I decided to wait. As I was waiting my cell phone rang. It was a colleague. She asked if I was OK. I told her I was fine and if she could call my wife to let her know where I was and that I was safe. She said she would and we hung up. I tried to make an outbound call but I couldn't get a signal. At least my wife would know I was safe. I waited a few more minutes and tried the phone again. This time I got though to my home. I told my wife my situation and bits and pieces of what happened. I told her how I was getting out. I told her I loved her. People from the crowd started asking me to use my phone. I was afraid if I hung up I wouldn't get another signal so I asked people to give me their names and the phone numbers they wanted to call. I relayed them to my wife and we got messages to about a dozen families, including two NYC Firemen who had just escaped the tower's collapse.Finally some tug boats pulled up to the seawall. One by one they loaded up people who were waiting in Battery Park and they took us over to Liberty State Park in New Jersey. During the short ride across the bay no one spoke. We all just looked back in horror and grief at the spot where the World Trade Center had been standing and was now burning ash.\n\n<em>Originally published on <a href=\"http://giolist.com/2002/09/my-911-story.html\">giolist.com</a></em>\n",

It requires you to upload your catalog (that would tie me a while since I have about 16 gigs of music), you can stream it to any device, and you can cache tracks on your devices for those long plane rides.

				"title": "Will I Switch to a Verizon iPhone?",
				"content_html": "<p>A lot of people have been asking me if I will switch when the iPhone is available on the Verizon Wireless network. The short answer: Probably not. Here is my thinking.\nFirst, I&rsquo;m assuming there is a huge pent-up demand for the iPhone on Verizon.  That will consist of existing Verizon customer and a slew of disgruntled AT&amp;T customers who have been itching to switch because of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s less than stellar network.  This is going to mean a ton of new subscribers hitting the Verizon network with data hungry iPhones.  I have a feeling Verizon&rsquo;s cellular network will bend and probably break under the strain. So the Verizon network might get worse for the first few quarters while it&rsquo;s under rapid expansion of subscribers and the load on the network increases.  There hasn&rsquo;t been a CDMA version of the iPhone so we are not sure how it will behave on that network. The result may be a poor network experience for all those new switchers.\nSecond, I have to buy a new phone. My existing iPhone won&rsquo;t work on the Verizon network so I&rsquo;ll have to buy a new phone and new plan with Verizon.  Which means I&rsquo;ll have to cover two plans at once.  Just to switch to Verizon. Not terrible but not ideal.\nFinally, I remember all the issues that AT&amp;T had with activations when they first launched the iPhone a few years ago.  We don&rsquo;t know the details but there were a lot of processes between Apple and AT&amp;T that weren&rsquo;t fully baked and tested.  The first few months were a bit rough for users with activation problems.  Apple can certainly bring a ton of experience to bear but Verizon is new to the iPhone. I anticipate glitches in the Apple/Verizon backend system integration that might cause issues for new switchers.\nSo I&rsquo;m going to uncharacteristically sit on the sidelines for this launch. I have been happier with AT&amp;T service over the past 6 months.  It seems to be getting better, although I haven&rsquo;t traveled to Mountain View lately.  It&rsquo;s been working very well in the NYC Metro area. Who knows.  Maybe all those folks fleeing AT&amp;T just might give us some more bandwidth and improve quality of service for those of us left behind on AT&amp;T.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Like a lot of gamers out there I&rsquo;ve been logging my fair share of hours (and kills) in Treyarch&rsquo;s Call of Duty: Black Ops. You know, the game that recently grossed about 650 million the weekend it was released? The game where you join in hours of endless, deadly, pretend combat, in savage team death matches. Yeah, that one.\nYou can imagine how fascinated I was when I came across the article <a href=\"http://sidemission.com/index.php/moral-relativism-in-a-black-ops-world-and-being-better-humans\">Moral Relativism in a Black Ops World, and being better humans</a> by Jeffrey MacCormack.  The first half of the article read like criticism of the typical players behavior in multiplayer online combat. I think most people would be somewhat shocked by the behavior of some of my in-game compadres.  I mean how do you explain to a normal person that your opponent is heaping on generous helpings of humiliation on you by pretending to tea-bag your now bullet riddled body? Kind of hard to wrap your mind around if you don&rsquo;t play, but the second half of the article is a bit more interesting.\nMacCormack suggests that all the attention Call of Duty (CoD) is garnering these days may be co-opted to change the real world for the better.  What&rsquo;s the cause he wants my fellow couch-bound war fighters to tackle? Child soldiers. More specifically, helping to reduce the types of weapons that make child soldiers even possible.\nI had never considered that it wouldn&rsquo;t really be impractical to use a child as a soldier without a weapon that a small person could fire. It turns out that small machine guns (SMGs) are the weapon of choice dictators and warlords use to equip these poor children and they are pretty common in CoD.

				"content_text": "Like a lot of gamers out there I've been logging my fair share of hours (and kills) in Treyarch's Call of Duty: Black Ops. You know, the game that recently grossed about 650 million the weekend it was released? The game where you join in hours of endless, deadly, pretend combat, in savage team death matches. Yeah, that one.\nYou can imagine how fascinated I was when I came across the article <a href=\"http://sidemission.com/index.php/moral-relativism-in-a-black-ops-world-and-being-better-humans\">Moral Relativism in a Black Ops World, and being better humans</a> by Jeffrey MacCormack.  The first half of the article read like criticism of the typical players behavior in multiplayer online combat. I think most people would be somewhat shocked by the behavior of some of my in-game compadres.  I mean how do you explain to a normal person that your opponent is heaping on generous helpings of humiliation on you by pretending to tea-bag your now bullet riddled body? Kind of hard to wrap your mind around if you don't play, but the second half of the article is a bit more interesting.\nMacCormack suggests that all the attention Call of Duty (CoD) is garnering these days may be co-opted to change the real world for the better.  What's the cause he wants my fellow couch-bound war fighters to tackle? Child soldiers. More specifically, helping to reduce the types of weapons that make child soldiers even possible. \nI had never considered that it wouldn't really be impractical to use a child as a soldier without a weapon that a small person could fire. It turns out that small machine guns (SMGs) are the weapon of choice dictators and warlords use to equip these poor children and they are pretty common in CoD.  MacCormack would like CoD players to contact Treyarch support and ask them to remove SMGs from the next version of CoD.  An in game embargo won't change the real world situation but it might draw big media attention to the problem. I would suggest that even a half step might help. Just ban the use of SMGs in the game for a week. I know a lot of players would bitch about that but it would be for a good cause. It might just cause a minor media frenzy.

				"content_html": "<p>Over the long weekend my three year old Canon printer gave up the ghost. Some kind of power supply problem. Normally I would be upset but the event simply gave me a perfect excuse to buy a new printer. Since I recently updated all my iOS devices to 4.2, that new printer would be one that supports ePrint which would let me print from my recently updated iPhone or iPad.\nI found the <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4356\">iOS: AirPrint 101</a> doc from Apple very helpful.  It told me <em>exactly</em> what printers supported AirPrint. Be forewarned. Not all ePrint compatible printers support AirPrint. Stick to the list supplied by Apple. I settled on the <a href=\"http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/18972-18972-238444-421635-410635-4021933.html\">HP PHOTOSMART PLUS e-All-IN-ONE B210</a>. It not only supported ePrint but wifi, decent photo printing, and scanning. It&rsquo;s perfect for a home printer.\nConfiguring the printer hardware took about 5 minutes. Nothing out of the ordinary. The printer chugged along, cycling through diagnostics, finally prompting me to configure the wireless connection. Once that was complete, the printer emitted a diagnostic page with some information about the ePrint setup. (More about this below.) On each of my Mac OS X machines I installed the drivers, added the printer, and printed a test page or two. Each worked fine.\nThere is nothing to install on your iOS devices to take advantage of AirPrint. You just need to update to iOS 4.2 and AirPrint should just work. I used the aforementioned AirPrint 101 doc as a guide. My tests with the standar apps (Mail and Safari) were fine and went as advertised. I was also able to view the print queue right from my iOS device by double pressing the home button and tapping on the AirPrint &ldquo;app&rdquo; running in the multitasking area of the iPhone and iPad. Everything just worked. The only disappointing bit was printing from Pages. That didn&rsquo;t work or at least there was no print button off the share button. I also tried Numbers and Keynote. No joy there as well. I have updated the apps recently so I&rsquo;m not sure when these apps will have the print button. I would think Apple would have included this in the last update.\nThere is a workaround for apps that don&rsquo;t have the print button. The ePrint configuration on the HP printer creates a special, Internet accessible, email address. It looks something like <code>asdf123asdf@hpeprint.com</code>. If you email documents to that email address it will print on your printer.  It&rsquo;s a great feature but you need to make sure you lock down just what email addresses can send to your printer. Anyone that knows the email address can print to your ePrint printer. As a safety measure, HP allows you to restrict what email addresses can send jobs to the printer. This setup is pretty simple and the instructions are printed on that first page the printer prints at the end of the hardware setup. I tested this from Numbers and it worked fine. A bit annoying but it&rsquo;s functional.\nOverall I&rsquo;m quite happy with AirPrint so far.  The HP printer works great.  Apps that support Airprint work flawlessly. While I&rsquo;m waiting for the rest of the apps I care to print from to support it, I can use the standard ePrint via email. But like all things iOS this is just going to get better as time passes. Pretty magical, eh?</p>\n",
