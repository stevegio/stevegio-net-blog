			 <p>Might be some odd things happening with the work I did yesterday here on micro.blog. I believe all posts should be appearing if you check <a href="https://stevegio.net">stevegio.net</a> however <a href="https://microblog.stevegio.net">microblog.stevegio.net</a> is stale. Whatever is going on I may have managed to fix an issue with my posts not showing up on the timeline. Waiting to hear back from the support forum to see if there is a fix or if I‚Äôm just doing (or have done) something wrong.</p>

			 <p>Paddled about 40 minutes to a small secluded cove off the inlet at Barnegat Light. Such a beautiful spot. My only company were a few sea gulls and cormorants feeding off the small fish in the water. Collected some odd bits of plastic to leave the place cleaner than it was before I got there. I like to think this kind of cleanup makes a difference. After all, I didn‚Äôt use to do this but was inspired by an older couple who regularly picked up plastic while they walked up and down the beach.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://overcast.fm/+B06_Hdzdk">Fuck Your Feelings</a> is a remarkable episode of the Love &amp; Radio Podcast. I found it to be profoundly disturbing yet enlightening. I struggle mightily to understand Trump supporters. This at least gives me an insight into the psychology of some. The desire to simplify daily existence seems like a key motivator. It‚Äôs a desire driven not by fear but fatigue in dealing with the world as it is. Of course that‚Äôs great if your cis, white, and well off. If not the reality of the world has a way of hitting you in the face with a 2x4 on a constant basis. Winding the cultural clock back to the 1950s is a shitty idea.</p>

			 <p>I can‚Äôt believe an entire year has passed since I upgraded to iPhone 7 plus. I love my iPhone and the plus form factor. My initial reason for going <strong>plus</strong> was to get the better camera features, it is after all my primary camera, but I found myself actually enjoying having the larger screen.
While the iPhone 7 plus was an improvement over my iPhone 6 plus in almost every way it wasn‚Äôt a big leap in technology. That big leap in technology arrived today in the form of the iPhone X.</p>

<h2>Unboxing</h2>

<p>The most remarkable moment unboxing the phone is when you see the screen for the first time. It‚Äôs amazing how much it reminds me of the iPhone 3g and 3 gs. The chrome band around the face, the rounded corners are really striking after staring at the 7 plus front face for over a year and previous generations for ten.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/390/2025/3e771d01c6.jpg" width="650" height="488">
The lack of a home button also takes you aback. How are you going to unlock and work the damn thing? It brought the realization that I was going to have to learn a few gestures before I could even use this new phone.
Getting the phone out of the box revealed the usual iPhone accessories. The usual charging block, USB-Lightning cable, wired ear buds, and headphone jack dongle are all under the phone.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>In anticipation of getting the X, I started off the day making an encrypted backup on my laptop. I want all my settings and health data restored on the new phone so an encrypted back is the only way to transfer them to the new phone. Prior to the backup iTunes reminded me to install iOS 11 which I did assuming the iPhone X would come pre-installed with it.
The new install process is very slick. Just put the phone next to another iOS device, enter your phone unlock pin, and the initial critical settings are transferred. The Face ID registration was very fast, probably less than a minute. Activation on the cellular network failed the first time but worked fine on the first retry. The last step asked me if I wanted to set the X up as a new phone or restore from iCloud or iTunes backup. I picked iTunes and connected the phone to my laptop. Then iTunes threw up a warning that my phone was running an older version of iOS and I would have to update the phone. (Airhorns)
The upgrade took agonizingly long. I was getting antsy. I tried not to freak out when I saw the estimated time start at 2 hours, drop to 40 minutes, and then start counting down at 20 minutes. The actual upgrade took around 30-40 minutes. When it was done, I was able to get the backup restored to the phone and I was in. Here are some quick notes on my experience.</p>

<h2>Size</h2>

<p>After being in the ‚ÄúPlus Club‚Äù for so long this phone feels tiny in my hands. It feels small and as when holding other non-plus phones it should feel disappointing because of the non-plus screen size but not with this iPhone. The screen goes out to the edges. It looks so large in comparison to how it feels. It‚Äôs like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS">Tardis</a> of iPhones.</p>

<h2>True Tone</h2>

<p>This is the first device I own with True Tone and I don‚Äôt think I want another device without True Tone. The color of this display is stunning. There were some times when I felt like I was looking at a printed page. It‚Äôs like looking at a Retina display for the first time. You never want to look at a non-retina display ever again.</p>

<h2>The Notch</h2>

<p>I thought I would hate it. It‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt <strong>hate</strong> it. But you stop noticing in in portrait mode. The same can not be said when you rotate the phone on it‚Äôs side. That black notch in my beautiful screen is <strong>very</strong> noticeable when you hold the phone in landscape. We are all going to need to get use to this new <strong>feature</strong> of our phones.</p>

<h2>Face ID</h2>

<p>Face ID works great and works best when you don‚Äôt think about it. During my first few minutes with the phone I did have a couple of misfires. One because of the angle of my phone (almost pointed away from my face) and the other because I flubbed the unlock gesture. After two to three minutes you just get used to it. Everything gets smoother when you just start to <strong>expect</strong> that it works. The new unlock gesture is that easy to learn.
Later when I jumped in my car, Face ID worked fine with my sun glasses on and the phone at a low angle/position relative to my face. I thought for sure it wouldn‚Äôt work 100% of the time but sure enough it was reliable.</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>This phone is fast. It‚Äôs noticeably faster than my 7 plus.</p>

<h2>Feelings After One Day</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs not a minor incremental improvement. It‚Äôs a leap forward. It‚Äôs a blast to learn the new features, some so fundamental to the operation of the device.
Very happy with this phone. Glad I upgraded.</p>

			 <p>Maybe it‚Äôs just that time of year but I‚Äôve been craving books, music, and podcasts of a supernatural variety. I‚Äôm in a spooky mood and I want to hang out with mad scientists, aliens from other planets, vat-grown monsters, and children of the night. I‚Äôm not sure how I ended up rediscovering it but the <a href="http://www.welcometonightvale.com/">Welcome to Night Vale</a> podcast hits the spot.<img class=" size-full wp-image-593 alignright" src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/390/2025/c6340dbe20.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="252"></p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with Night Vale, it is a strange place in the deserts of the American southwest. The podcast is a recording of the radio broadcast of one of its denizens. It features local news, PSAs, and special announcements. That would be pretty mundane in most places but not in Night Vale.</p>

<p>Night Vale is a nightmarish place inhabited by strange hooded figures, feral dogs, trans dimensional beings, and indescribable shapes that no one speaks of. The entire place is governed by a the town council and the sheriff‚Äôs secret police. The sky is patrolled by strange helicopters that vary in menace depending on what color they happen to be that day, that is when it‚Äôs not filled with strange glowing lights. Night Vale feels like a mashup of Twin Peaks, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things">Hawkins, Indiana</a>, and resort community designed by H.P. Lovecraft.</p>

<p>I first became aware of Night Vale back in 2012. I‚Äôve been revisiting this strange place by replaying old episodes. I‚Äôm glad to see it survives after five years as an active podcast with many spin-off shows and books.</p>

<p>If you want a bit of black magic and mystery in your life, <a href="http://www.welcometonightvale.com/listen">subscribe</a>. I recommend it. See you at the dog park&hellip;or not.</p>

			 <p>Cambridge, MA eating an Atomic Meatloaf Meltdown and drinking a Harpoon Ale. I was alone so I picked up a local music trade paper and was leafing through it when I stumbled upon a review for the album &ldquo;i&rdquo; by MMOSS a psychedelic jam band from New Hampshire. I was intrigued. After finishing my meal I went out an bought the CD somewhere near Harvard Square and I&rsquo;ve been a fan ever since. <br>I&rsquo;m pretty sure they have only recently been available on Spotify and it looks like a re-issue of &ldquo;i&rdquo; is available. My pick for the week is &ldquo;Hedge Creeper&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a fun jam full of late 60s AM radio tropes. I think Ron Burgundy is playing lead jazz flute on this one. Enjoy this track while driving with the top down.</p>

			 <p>A friend forwarded me this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/can-the-swiss-watchmaker-survive-the-digital-age.html?smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;_r=0">NY Times article</a> about the mechanical watch makers responding to the Apple Watch. It prompted me to write a long email response which I thought would make a good blog post. So here goes.</p>

<p>After wearing the Apple Watch Sport for more than a month now I can tell you it‚Äôs going to stay on my wrist. It is not a reduction of the phone but rather an extension of it. A very useful one. I‚Äôve purchased two additional color bands that I switch depending on what I‚Äôm wearing. I plan on purchasing additional straps/bands as interesting designers start creating them for Apple Watch.</p>

<p>I use Apple Watch for telling the time, fitness tracking, managing my appointments, and for checking messages/notifications. I‚Äôve filtered down notifications so that only the most important make it to the Apple Watch. When I get a gentle tap on the wrist I simply glance at my watch to see the notification. If it&rsquo;s a message that I can use a canned response for then I just reply right from the watch. I don‚Äôt take my phone out of my pocket if I get a notification on the phone. As a result, I use the phone a little less.</p>

<div>I purchased the Apple Watch Sport because it is inevitable that subsequent versions of the watch will improve. I will purchase a more expensive stainless steel model when it includes GPS and better water resistance. I‚Äôd like to keep it on when I'm swimming or kayaking. (I know a touch screen that works submerged is a tall order.) I‚Äôd also like to see them make the watch bigger. The current 42mm looks fine on my wrist but I wouldn‚Äôt mind a larger face. I‚Äôve worn Suunto watches in the past and I‚Äôd love to see Apple make a watch with that form factor. I will probably never consider buying the gold watch.</div>

<div></div>

<div>I‚Äôve always worn watches mostly inexpensive Swatch watches (I am a child of the 80s) but much as I drool over mechanical watches, I can‚Äôt justify the cost. They are beautiful objects and I especially marvel at the models with multiple interesting complications. They are truly wonderful. Even with Apple entering the fray, I don‚Äôt think expensive mechanical watches are going anywhere. There will always be a market for them. All these hybrid watches these guys are trying to create to compete are a mistake. I mean, smart straps? It‚Äôs like building a hybrid Lamborghini. Yes, there is an overlap between people who want expensive mechanical watches and smart watch functionality. I think that market is smaller than the overall mechanical watch market and way smaller than the market for smart watches.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Apple is going to take a great chunk of the smart watch market by making very compelling products. Like phones they aren‚Äôt going to dominate market share but they will take most of the profits because of their complete mastery of logistics and manufacturing. They will likely compete with mechanical watch makers at the periphery, maybe for the sub-thousand dollar segment. They will continue to improve not only the function but the materials that make up the watch as well. I doubt they are going to really threaten high-end mechanical watch makers. As long as there are people with money and expensive tastes, mechanical watchmakers will fine. It‚Äôs everyone else that's in trouble.</div>

I just worked a 4700-hour week digging a tunnel under Mordor with a screwdriver."

They have a point. Mordor sucks, and it's certainly more physically taxing to dig a tunnel than poke at a keyboard unless you're an ant. But, for the sake of the argument, can we agree that stress and insanity are bad things? Awesome. Welcome to programming.

			 <p>The other day I listened to &ldquo;<a href="http://toe.prx.org/2014/12/wishful-thinking-the-dislike-club-part-iv/">Wishful Thinking</a>&rdquo; the latest &ldquo;dislike club&rdquo; episode of Benjamen Walker&rsquo;s <a href="http://toe.prx.org">Theory of Everything</a>¬†podcast. This series of episodes focuses on the current, sad, state of the Internet. How it&rsquo;s turned from an amazing place where ideas, thoughts, and emotions are freely exchanged into¬†a virtual gulag. A place where we slave away trading our personal information, endlessly liking things,¬†to generate profits for big companies.</p>

<p>This last episode focuses on online harassment and it&rsquo;s quite powerful. The Internet is probably one of the last places you can make someone&rsquo;s life absolutely miserable and suffer zero consequences. Not surprisingly most of the victims here are women and it can get so bad that they must leave the Internet, dis-engage from public life, because of it. If the behavior most women face online happened in the workplace people lose their jobs and get prosecuted. When it happens online, nothing happens to the individual or group responsible. This kind of behavior has to stop.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, this week the people over at the Tor Project posted ¬†<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/solidarity-against-online-harassment">Solidarity Against Online Harassment</a>. Read it. Sign your name,¬†but more importantly, <strong>act</strong>. Fight this crap everyday. Defend those being harassed, condemn this behavior, and cast a critical eye at your own behavior.</p>

<p>The Internet is probably the greatest freedom machine ever built. My freedom has to stop where it might infringe on your freedom and your ability to express your ideas.</p>

			 <p>I do a lot of apple watching and over time I&rsquo;ve whittled down the number of places I go for such information. Recently Neil Cybart (a former stock analyst) launched <a href="http://www.aboveavalon.com">Above Avalon</a> a throwback email newsletter that covers Apple from a finance angle. I normally would have unsubscribed by now, who needs more email, but Cybart has me hooked. Just today he introduced me to a few new companies with apps in a growing space aimed at the financial consumers: <a href="https://www.robinhood.com">Robinhood</a>, <a href="https://www.affirm.com">Affirm</a>, and <a href="https://www.hioscar.com">Oscar</a>. (Robinhood sounds particularly interesting to me.) Short and to the point, I look forward to reading Above Avalon every weekday. I recommend it to anyone interested in news related to Apple as a business.</p>

			 <p>Dropping two tracks that had been on heavy rotation at the beach house this year. The first is a jam by the Swedish band Goat titled &ldquo;Hide from the Sun&rdquo;. I love the heavily fuzzed out guitar line about 2/3 in to this one. The second is &ldquo;Dawn of Time&rdquo; by the San Diego reggae band Tribal Seeds. I know San Diego isn&rsquo;t normally the place I would go to seek out this kind of music but this track goes great with sand, surf, and sunshine.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been out at Apple&rsquo;s World Wide Developer Conference all week in San Francisco drinking from the fire hose of new information related to all the goodness they released on Monday. Music always plays a big part at almost every Apple event from the music they play between sessions to the guest band that plays the wrap up &ldquo;bash&rdquo; at the end of the week. This year Bastille played a set. ¬†They weren&rsquo;t bad. Not a band I would seek out but they have some quirks that intrigue me. The band is obsessed with the TV show Twin Peaks and are fond of doing covers. Last night they played TLC&rsquo;s &ldquo;No Scrubs&rdquo; and just for fun they mash that up with the guitar riff and a verse or two from The XX&rsquo;s &ldquo;Angels&rdquo;. Anyhoo, I couldn&rsquo;t find that track on Spotify so I&rsquo;m throwing in &ldquo;Laura Palmer&rdquo;. Not my typical pick but what the hell it&rsquo;s catchy and it was fun to pogo too at the show.</p>

			 <p>About four years ago I was sitting in the All Star Sandwich Bar in¬†Cambridge, MA eating an Atomic Meatloaf Meltdown and drinking a Harpoon Ale. I was alone so I picked up a local music trade paper and was leafing through it when I stumbled upon a review for the album &ldquo;i&rdquo; by MMOSS a psychedelic jam band from New Hampshire. I was intrigued. After finishing my meal I went out an bought the CD somewhere near Harvard Square and I&rsquo;ve been a fan ever since.
I&rsquo;m pretty sure they have only recently been available on Spotify and it looks like a re-issue of &ldquo;i&rdquo; is available. My pick for the week is &ldquo;Hedge Creeper&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a short fun jam full of late 60s AM radio tropes. I think Ron Burgundy is playing lead jazz flute on this one. Enjoy this track while driving with the top down.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m just getting around to listening to Woods April release &ldquo;With Light and With Love&rdquo;. I like what I hear. My pick for the week is the title track. It kicks off with a McGuinn-esque guitar riff that weaves it&rsquo;s way through the various structures the band has erected in this song. I&rsquo;ll ask for forgiveness in advance. It&rsquo;s a bit long but it is complex enough to hold my interest through the full 9:07. Another less lengthy track which I also dig is &ldquo;Moving to the Left&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t wait to hear more from the band. I&rsquo;ve been a fan since their 2011 release &ldquo;Sun and Shade&rdquo;. Enjoy!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to make sense of Apple&rsquo;s acquisition of Beats by Dre. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/9/5698158/what-apple-is-really-buying-with-beats/in/5470807">This Verge article</a> made me understand that the Beats hardware business is very similar to Apple&rsquo;s. They sell well designed hardware at high margins. That makes perfect sense. Then I started thinking about how do you deal with two iconic brands merging together like that? Will iPhones suddenly be packaged with a little sticker or stenciling on the back of the phone itself that says &ldquo;Audio Powered by Beats&rdquo;? I don&rsquo;t think so. But you can&rsquo;t just buy Beats and toss the brand. Then it hit me. What if Beats becomes the core of a new iTunes? What if Beats (the brand, the headphones, the music service, the execs, their relationships, everything) becomes the new music eco-system for Apple? .</p>

<p>The Beats acquisition is the beginning of the end of iTunes. iTunes is a bloated desktop app which is overloaded with functions. It&rsquo;s how we buy music, movies, etc. It&rsquo;s how we used to buy books and apps before the iBooks and App stores. iTunes needs to be broken up. It is being broken up and this move by Apple is how they handle the music aspect of this transition.</p>

<p>If this is Apples intent¬†are there other media related companies¬†Apple could buy¬†in TV or the movie industry? Do the try to build as in iBooks or buy as in Beats for the rest of what&rsquo;s left of iTunes? This will be fun to watch. Maybe as fun as hearing Dr. Dre say a few words at a WWDC keynote.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of country and western music. But when I came across Sturgill Simpson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Turtles all the Way Down&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t just toss it onto that heap of music reserved for cowboys crying in their beer. I mean how can you ignore a song with lyrics like:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a gateway in our mind that leads somewhere <br> far beyond this plane,<br> Where reptile aliens made of light open you up<span class="text_exposed_show"><br> take out all your pain</span></p>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Jesus, Buddha, the Devil, and a whole host of hallucinogens have been put in a blender, mixed with Jack, whipped into a froth and served up in a frosty mug in this song. Take a gulp and you'll get that hippy love aftertaste. I'll be waiting for the rest of the tracks from this album to hit Spotify. I hope y'all like it.

			 <p>The Coathangers (Minnie, Crook Kid, and Rusty) are an all female punk rock band out of Atlanta, GA. Their third album, Suck My Shirt, is chock full of bite sized, fast hitting tracks. The songs aren&rsquo;t that complex (hey, it&rsquo;s punk) but what draws me in are their voices. Rusty and Minnie sing in two very distinct styles: one rough gravely, the other softer and more controlled. Individually or together it works for me. &ldquo;Adderall&rdquo; has that raw sound that makes me wince. I can only imagine what her throat feels after belting that one out. The vocal style on &ldquo;Merry Go Round&rdquo; does a 180. It reminds me so much of¬†a young Kate Pierson. Maybe it&rsquo;s a tip of the hat towards Athens? The Coathangers are a blast¬†and my pick for the week is the track &ldquo;Smother&rdquo;. Turn it up loud, give it a listen, and let me know what¬†you think.</p>

While I don't pay much attention to these festivities, one particular nominee was hard to avoid. ¬†Idina Menzel and "Let It Go" has to be one of the wickedest ear worms to arrive in recent memory. No question the girl has a set of pipes, but the sound is sickly sweet. Too perfect. It's even harder to avoid if you have any contact ¬†with children under the age of 13.

(Spotify really needs to fix this.) Anyway, one artist I dabbled with was Dan Deacon.¬† Deacon is an electronic composer/musician currently based in Baltimore. The track I&rsquo;m selecting this week is &ldquo;Prettyboy&rdquo; from the album &ldquo;America&rdquo;. I love this track. It&rsquo;s a combination of rich circular sythns, injected with what sounds like analog percussion, sprinkled with bubbling oboes. It&rsquo;s one of those soundtrack pieces you imagine being used in the movie of your life.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t go to a ton of shows in 2013 but it&rsquo;s no question that the highlight was the Halloween Blood Bath in San Francisco with the Flaming Lips, Tame Impala, and White Denim.

<p>The Flaming Lips are not shy about breaking out a great cover now and again. When I saw them earlier in 2013 they produced a superb straight version of &ldquo;Heroes&rdquo;. I gave me goose bumps. ¬†Halloween they managed to deliver a surprise cover of Devo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gates of Steel&rdquo;. Wayne Coyne dedicated it to Alan Meyers (who passed away that summer) and all the other freaks in the audience. It was a great tribute. The original is my pick for this week.</p>

			 <p>Mogwai have just dropped a new sythn soaked album &ldquo;Rave Tapes&rdquo;. Quite a departure for the Scottish post-rock band. I like it a lot. &ldquo;Simon Ferocious&rdquo; is one of my favorite tracks. It pushes the syths right up front but supports them with some great electric guitar work more typical of the bands signature sound.</p>

			 <p>On April Fool&rsquo;s Day 1985, XTC released &ldquo;25 O&rsquo;Clock&rdquo; an album under the name The Dukes of Stratosphear. It consisted of songs that sound like they were recorded in 1967 and was produced by John Leckie, who recorded and produced albums by George Harrison, Pink Floyd, and Syd Barrett. ¬†Leckies combined XTC&rsquo;s sound with instrumentation and analog recording techniques of the golden age of psychedelic music. The result is simply magical or it was in 1985 when I first heard it.
Many consider this album just an April Fool&rsquo;s Day joke, but I think their love of this kind of music. It certainly echoes strongly in their next release &ldquo;Skylarking&rdquo;. &ldquo;25 O&rsquo;Clock&rdquo; was 6 tracks of pure joy and later in the year they release a CD with 16 tracks. My picks for this week are &ldquo;What in the World&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vanishing Girl&rdquo;. Just listen to Colin Moulding&rsquo;s bass work on that first track. It just sounds like he&rsquo;s channeling McCartney. If you really dig this kind of music play the entire album. It&rsquo;s a blast.</p>

			 <p>To borrow a phrase from Frank Zappa: folk-rock is not dead, it just smells funny. This was the first thought that entered my mind when I started listening to Wolf People late in 2013.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I woke up in a hotel room in Cleveland Ohio yesterday morning. Mid way through my morning routine I discovered my iPad 3 was missing. It wasn't in my bag but it only took a fraction of second for me to realize where it was. The night before I had flown to Cleveland from Chicago on a late flight. Minutes before I had dozed off I had placed the iPad in the seat back pocket in front of me. ¬†It happened to me once before but in that case someone from the airline called me thirty or so minutes after I left the airport to tell me I left it behind. ¬†I received no such call this time.</p><p>I had configured the "Find My Device" feature of iCloud on this iPad which has helped me locate it a few times when I've misplaced it or left it at the office. ¬†So I thought I would just login to iCloud and see if my iPad was at the airport locked up in some lost and found cabinet with dozens of other similar devices, scarves, gloves, pens, sunglasses, etc. I was flying back home that night so I figured I could just pick it up on my way out of Cleveland. I clicked on the link to show the map with the location of my iPad. There it was indicated on the map as a bright green dot but it wasn't at the airport. <em>Crap.</em> It was at a residential address in a suburb of Cleveland, a bad suburb of Cleveland. <em>Shit!¬†</em>It looks like someone involved with turning that airplane around last night decided to take it home.</p><p>I called the airline. ¬†Explained the situation. ¬†I filed a missing property report. Gave them the current location of my iPad. While they were sympathetic they advised me to call the Cleveland police. At that point a bunch of thoughts entered my mind. ¬†<em>Maybe the person brought it home because lost and found was closed? ¬†Maybe they were going to bring it back to the airport when their shift started again? If I get the cops involved would I be making someone's already difficult life way more difficult?</em>¬†<em>Damn it! Who's dumb enough to steal an iOS device and leave it on!¬†</em>Since my iPad had a lock screen the person who took it couldn't just get in and wipe it.¬†I decided to use the "Lost Mode" which allows you to send a message to the device. I wrote, "Hi, I want my iPad back. I won't press charges." and I included my phone number. ¬†Within minutes someone shut the device off. ¬†The green dot on the map turned into a grey one.</p><p>I called the police and filed a report. They asked me all the details. They also took the address that I had obtained from iCloud. The officer who took the report mentioned that this has happened before and they didn't have any luck getting the device back. He said he would get back to me. I felt bad involving the police. They probably had way more important stuff to deal with than this kind of petty crime. ¬†But they took all the information and said they would follow up. ¬†I thought that would be the last I would ever talk to them again.</p><p>I was in town with one of my account execs to meet with a customer so I was in meetings most of the day. It was in the back of my mind the whole time.</p><p>About an hour later, during a customer meeting, my phone rang. It was a Cleveland number. ¬†Since I was with the client I let it go to voicemail. During a break I called the number back. ¬†The person who owned the phone had set up a "ring back tone" which is basically a song that plays instead of the normal ringing sound. ¬†The song the person set up was the theme song from Hawaii Five-O by The Ventures. I laughed out loud because I had a pretty good idea this was the number of an officer from the Cleveland PD. ¬†Turns out I was correct. ¬†After he picked up my call, he said they had looked up the address, talked to the airline, and confirmed that a cleaning contractor lived at that address. He said he didn't have a warrant or anything but he was going to go over and "knock on the door" and call me when he knew anything. ¬†My hopes of getting my iPad back were lifting at the same time my thoughts about the person who took it were sinking. They were in deep do-do. ¬†At this point even if they brought it back to the airport lost and found the airline and the police knew they had walked off with it. ¬†This person was going to lose a job over this at a minimum.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later my phone rang again. I couldn't take the call so I called back when we got to a break in the customer meeting. ¬†I called back, listened to the the Hawaii Five-O theme, and then the CPD officer picked up. He said he had no luck getting anyone to answer the door but he had a feeling someone was in the house. ¬†They probably knew they were in trouble. ¬†He said he would try again later. I went back to my meeting.</p><p>Our meeting with the customer was over and we had a lot of time to kill before our flights home, so we decided to take a quick tour of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ¬†As we were buying the tickets I noticed I missed a call. ¬†It was the CPD officer. ¬†I called his number back, listened to the Hawaii Five-O theme, and the officer picked up. He told me he had recovered the iPad from the person who stole it. I was blown away. ¬†I thanked him profusely. He told me he was going to drop it off with the CPD at the airport. I would need to fill out some paperwork but I could pick it up on my way out of Cleveland.</p><p>I consider myself lucky. This wasn't a cheap iPad. It was a 64GB model with wifi and cellular. ¬†It would not have been cheap to replace. ¬†I did have iCloud "Find My iPad" turned on but a more competent thief would have turn the device off, making it impossible to locate, and just DFU restored the device back to factory settings. (iOS 7 would have eliminated that but I did not upgrade that device. It was still running iOS 6.) Finally, the CPD did a great job connecting the dots and retrieving the device. I am very grateful. ¬†As for the person that took it, they have probably lost their job over this. I feel bad but taking that iPad was dumb. It would have been so much easier to have done the right thing. Hopefully they won't do it again.</p><p>Oh... one other odd thing happened. Toward the end of our tour of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame we entered the Hall of Inductees. ¬†There is a film loop of all the Inductees accepting their awards, performing and giving interviews playing in the hall. When we walked in the inductees from 2008 were up on the screen. ¬†One of the bands inducted that year was¬†<a href="http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-ventures/">The Ventures</a>. ¬†Life is weird.</p><p>¬†</p><p>¬†</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Ever since it&rsquo;s introduction in iOS 6, the iOS Passbook has become an indispensable feature of my iPhone. At any given time it contains at a minimum 3-4 passes and at times I have as many as 10 items stored in Passbook. I put everything I can into Passbook. Airline and train tickets, museum and event passes, and store loyalty cards all get stored in one convenient place. I&rsquo;m delighted when I interact with merchants that support Passbook and I try to avoid those that don&rsquo;t.
Using Passbook has eliminated having to print boarding and other travel related passes, which has probably saved me quite a bit of money on paper and ink jet cartridges over the last few years. Typical boarding passes print in color. The extra info junk printed on every airline boarding pass, even though the boarding pass doesn&rsquo;t take up one full sheet of US Letter sized paper, typically results in two sheets of paper are used for a single pass. All of it wasted. Not so if you are using Passbook.
Passbook even ensures that the right pass is available on the lock screen of my phone just when I need it.  This feature works great with travel or timed event related passes.  When it&rsquo;s time for me to hop on a train the train ticket is just there on my iPhone lock screen.  Because I travel a lot, this reduces travel stress and anxiety. Before I leave home I don&rsquo;t have to remember where stored my printed boarding pass (&rdquo;<em>Is it in my bag or my jacket or on the printer?!?</em>&rdquo;) In boarding lines, I&rsquo;m not fumbling around looking for the right ticket.
As someone involved in the business of software and technology, I like to think I&rsquo;m making the world better and delighting customers with the work I do. I can wholeheartedly proclaim that Passbook has simplified and enhanced this small part of my life. I hope someone at Apple picks this up and forwards it to the team responsible for creating this magical feature of iOS. I&rsquo;d like to let them know how great that product is and buy them a few beers.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently returned from a three week, three country, trip in Europe. It was a family vacation, no contact with the office, and we had an amazing time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in packing light. I try to stick to the &ldquo;one person, one bag&rdquo; rule which is difficult to achieve when it&rsquo;s your wife and teenage kids you are trying to convince. It was practically impossible when we first started traveling ¬†but over the years I&rsquo;ve been winning them over.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/stevegio/status/353876500904288257">twitter.com/stevegio/&hellip;</a></p>

<p>My iPhone goes with me wherever I go but this trip I decided to leave the laptop behind and travel exclusively with the the iPad. At first my family protested and even I had some concerns, but other than my wife and daughter missing a full keyboard, it was a big success. Here are some take-aways for anyone on the fence about further lightning your load by traveling all iOS.</p>

<p><strong>Gear and Cellular Connectivity</strong></p>

<p>I took my iPhone 5, my old iPhone 4s, an iPad 2 and an iPad 3. I left my US AT&amp;T SIM in my iPhone 5. ¬†I have an international calling plan on this phone normally, but I only used it sparingly to call the US. ¬†I also took along an old iPhone 3 for my wife.</p>

<p>I dropped a Vodaphone pre-paid SIM in my iPhone 4s and the iPhone 3 for local calling in Europe so we had a low cost way to call each other and to make local calls. I paid a bit extra to get data on the iPhone 4. ¬†This worked well but Vodaphone was not the best carrier for data. ¬†There were some areas where the data wouldn&rsquo;t work and we covered a lot of ground. ¬†I guess I could have called and debugged the situation, I was on vacation, and it wan&rsquo;t the end of the world. Paper maps, train schedules, etc still work fine in the modern age.</p>

<p><strong>Power and Charging</strong></p>

<p>I took the iPad 2 and 3 so I needed the small power brick to adequately charge these devices. Fortunately the brick deals with the different voltages all I had to do was buy the¬†<a title="Apple World Traveller Adapter Kit" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB974ZM/B/apple-world-travel-adapter-kit">Apple World Traveller Adapter Kit</a> to get the plug adapter I needed. It&rsquo;s a little pricy but it comes with any possible adapter you would need in the world and it does work to adapter you laptop power brick if you need it.</p>

<p><strong>Network Connectivity</strong></p>

<p>While I did use European SIMs for two of our iPhones, I did not do that with the iPads. ¬†So we were limited to WiFi only. Don&rsquo;t let this discourage you. WiFi is pretty ubiquitous in Europe. ¬†Each of the two apartments we rented, the three hotels, and the one B&amp;B we stayed at during the trip, all had <em>free</em> WiFi access. Many cafes and places you&rsquo;ll find on-the-go also have WiFi. ¬†That&rsquo;s handing for looking up train or tram information while dining al fresco. We had zero issues finding good bandwidth for email, web browsing, and uploads. It made researching places we wanted to see and getting map directions easier.</p>

<p><strong>Photo Upload/Backup</strong></p>

<p>I take a lot of pictures when we travel. This trip was no exception. This was also one of the reasons I felt most apprehensive about leaving the laptop behind. After a day of picture taking I normally sync my SD card to iPhoto, then use iPhoto to upload to <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>. Since I&rsquo;m not doing a lot of photo editing while I&rsquo;m on vacation I do this primarily to make sure I have a backup of my raw photos in multiple places and to clear out my SD card.</p>

<p>To interface my iPad to my SD cards I used the <a title="Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC531ZM/A/apple-ipad-camera-connection-kit">Apple¬†iPad Camera Connection Kit</a>. Getting the photos to Flickr turned out to be slightly more complicated. Flickr upload is apparently broken in the iOS version of iPhoto. ¬†I searched around the App Store and discovered <a title="PhotoSync" href="http://www.photosync-app.com">PhotoSync</a>¬†and it worked just fine uploading all my photos to my private set for archive.</p>

<p><strong>Local Apps</strong></p>

<p>One thing we discovered is that many European museums, cities, and points of interest have iOS and Android applications that you can download. ¬†Some of these apps help plan you visit, get the latest information on special exhibits, and even enhance your tour. ¬†The Louvre in Paris, for example, had an audio guide you could download for the iPhone. We found a number of these applications very useful.</p>

<p><strong>Other Travel Apps</strong></p>

<p>Trains, Trams, and subways are the way to get around European cities and almost all of them have iOS apps to help plan your trip. Some have English versions if you don&rsquo;t speak the local language but most can be operated with minimal local language skills. I found it fun to try to figure out some of the advisory notices. ¬†I found these apps indispensable and many worked without a network connection.¬†Also get local weather apps! They are more accurate than the ones you depend on in the US. Most US based weather apps will not have good coverage for some areas.</p>

<p><strong>Entertainment/News/etc.</strong></p>

<p>We filled our days with sight seeing but in the evening it was nice to come back to our temporary home read books, news, catch up on email, or play a game. For this kind of down time it goes without saying the iPad excels at home and it worked just fine outside the US. The only thing to watch out for is that most video services like Netflix and HBO Go would not work overseas. ¬†One notable exception was MLB At Bat which allowed my son to witness the collapse of the Phillys much to our chagrin.</p>

<p><strong>Mailbox</strong></p>

<p>You can imagine what you email inbox looks like after three weeks of vacation. ¬†I cheated a bit here and did check my personal and work email every day for anything urgent. ¬†One tool I found made it so much easier was <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">Mailbox</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using it on my iPhone and iPad to make processing emails for actions and I love it. ¬†The killer feature for me on this trip was the ability for Mailbox to &ldquo;snooze&rdquo; messages until a later date. ¬†That meant I could scan all my work email, respond to the critics, delete the junk, and then &ldquo;snooze&rdquo; all the other messages that could wait. This kept me with a clean inbox, and conscious, for the entire trip. Of course when the &ldquo;snooze&rdquo; date arrived so did all that email. All good things must come to an end I suppose.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Leaving the laptop behind was no problem for us. I think our iOS devices were more than adequate to help us travel and keep us connected and informed. The web and apps are everywhere. ¬†They make our lives easier at home and enhanced our travel experience abroad. The reduction in weight and bulk of dealing with an extra laptop bag was worth the trade off of not having a full sized keyboard and access to non-iOS apps. It kept us light and agile which made traveling from place to place easy. I think we made a great decision.</p>

			 <p>Last night I dreamt that I arrived at the office early. No one was there. I plugged my laptop into the monitor on my desk and refreshed my browser to access my Gmail account when, instead of the normal inbox view, I was greeted with a slick splash page.</p><p>"Welcome to Google+ Messages!" blared the interstitial. As I clicked through the slick web tour, festooned with beautiful photos young people, I read how I would be enjoying a new social messaging experience! Google had taken the next step in the evolution of messaging (which looked oddly like Facebook Messages) and integrated Gmail into Google+. I could now share messages with people in my circles, who could comment on every thread. My entire email inbox was splayed out into an activity stream with +1 buttons.</p><p>Like Taylor on that beach far in the future I screamed, "<b>YOU MANIACS! YOU BLEW IT UP! OH, DAMN YOU!

			 <p><blockquote>&ldquo;Officially, Google declared that ‚Äúsharing is broken on the web‚Äù&hellip;As it turned out, sharing was not broken. Sharing was working fine and dandy&hellip;&ldquo;¬†&ndash; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/415656/ProfileUrlRedirect.ashx">James Whittaker</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx">&ldquo;Why I left Google&rdquo;</a>
</blockquote>
Whittaker&rsquo;s exit post is an interesting look into one person&rsquo;s take on what&rsquo;s going on at Google right now. The few lines above really struck a chord with me. Whittaker goes on to state that sharing is happening a lot, mostly on Facebook, which is true but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way. Yes, it&rsquo;s easy to share on Facebook (maybe too easy) but starting a blog and publishing on your own site isn&rsquo;t that much more difficult. Discovery isn&rsquo;t a problem either since Google search indexes everything and if you want notifications services like Twitter, or better still <a href="http://join.app.net">App.net</a>,¬†can replace the wall/activity stream of content gulags like Facebook and Google+.</p>

<p>Whittaker quotes his daughter as saying &ldquo;social isn&rsquo;t a product&hellip;social is¬†<i>people</i>¬†and the people are on Facebook.&rdquo; Quite true. But the people are also all on the Internet and it&rsquo;s full of great ways to connect and share that don&rsquo;t involve turning your life over to one company. It might be easier but why give them all the power? Because everyone is there?</p>

			 <p>I have to admit my <a href="http://stevegio.net/2012/07/08/282-384/" title="Type 2 Diabetes">Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis</a> had not surprised me. I was in denial about my weight, lack of exercise, and poor diet. Once I got the news, I didn‚Äôt sit around feeling bad about it. I sprung into action. It was as if I gained a few extra points of IQ, recognized my exact position, and made an immediate resolution to beat it. I surprised myself.</p>
<p>The plan was simple. Lose the weight by altering my diet and starting an exercise program. By getting my weight under control, I might get my body‚Äôs systems back in balance, and reverse the diabetes. I wanted to take a data driven approach to everything I was doing. I wanted to watch the variables and measure results. I also believed seeing the results, viewing the data, would keep me motivated. If you can‚Äôt measure a system, you can‚Äôt improve it.</p>
<p>In those few days after my diagnosis I set a weight goal. Given my height and build I should be somewhere between 180 and 220 lbs. So I needed to lose about 50 lbs, a big goal. I had decided that reducing carbs and getting more proteins, an Atkins like diet, would work for me. I had had some success with it in the past, now I had a good incentive to do it right this time.
My weight was the big variable and tracking it would be critical. You can screw up a low carb diet and actually gain weight. Measuring my weight every day would help me fine tune what I was eating. I wanted this data capture to be very simple, so I ended up buying a <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/build-links/individual/simple-get-html.html?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B002JE2PSA&amp;assoc_ss_ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB002JE2PSA%3Fie%3DUTF8%26keywords%3DWhithings%26qid%3D1341780827%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1%26sr%3D8-1&amp;parentASIN=B004K28IEE" title="Whithings Body Scale">Whithings Body Scale</a>. Data capture is automatic. You weigh yourself and the scale updates your data over WiFi on the Withings site. You can view the data on their web site or with a free iPhone app. It‚Äôs pricy but it simplifies and makes weigh-ins more fun.</p>
<p>The second part of the plan was to get moving again. I did enjoy running in the past but though the easiest thing to do was to start walking. I set aside time every day to walk. The calories I would burn in conjunction with the low carb diet would help me take off the weight. I thought eventually I would start running again as the weight came off. For tracking my exercise and calories burned I chose <a href="http://runkeeper.com" title="RunKeeper">RunKeeper</a> on the iPhone. I love this app. Again it makes data collection, tracks all aspects of my workout, and keeps me motivated by alerting me to personal bests like ‚ÄúMost Activities in a Week‚Äù or ‚ÄúLongest Distance in an Activity‚Äù.
For testing and tracking blood glucose I‚Äôm using a <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/associates/network/build-links/individual/simple-get-html.html?ie=UTF8&amp;asin=B004DJ9208&amp;assoc_ss_ref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB004DJ9208%3Fie%3DUTF8%26keywords%3DContour%2520blood%2520glucose%2520monitor%26qid%3D1341781125%26ref_%3Dsr_1_19%26s%3Dhpc%26sr%3D1-19&amp;parentASIN=B004DJ9208" title="Contour Blood Glucose Meter">Contour Blood Glucose Meter</a> and the <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=WH3I6oZpD1M&amp;offerid=146261.353118307&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0">BGluMon - Blood Glucose Monitor</a><img border="0" width="1" height="1" src="http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=WH3I6oZpD1M&amp;bids=146261.353118307&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0"> iPhone app. This part of my toolset isn‚Äôt so automated but it is simple. The Contour unit it pretty easy to run although it does  take some time to getting use to jabbing yourself for blood, but these new monitors require so little blood. (A tip from my doc: stop sticking your fingers. You can get all the blood you need from the outside edge of your palm.) BGluMon is also pretty simple to use and it was the easiest most helpful app I could find to run stats on my blood glucose readings. I‚Äôve shown the graphs it generates of my numbers to my doc during visits.  Very handy.</p>
<p>The one big variable I‚Äôm not tracking closely is my calorie intake. I can‚Äôt seem to find a tool that will help me do this with minimal fuss. My rational here is that if I can keep the carbs out of my diet and if I can keep my meal sizes down, I won‚Äôt need to sweat the calories in count. I‚Äôd like to fix this eventually.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On December 28th 2012 I was sitting in the examination chair in my ophthalmologist&rsquo;s office. He was jotting down some notes on the eye exam I&rsquo;d just taken and failed. Since November of that year my distance vision was getting worse. It was so bad I was having trouble reading street signs while driving. Degrading vision isn&rsquo;t uncommon in 40-somethings so naturally I just needed glasses. Then my doc hit me with some questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been thirsty, like a lot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;, I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peeing a lot? Especially at night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember the third question because in that moment I new he was going to tell me. I had diabetes.</p>

<p>2011 was not a great health year for me. Work/Life was out of balance. I had let things go. I flew 100 thousand air miles that year. I was on the road getting little or no exercise. My diet consisted of fast food and big nighttime meals with clients. I had ballooned to 282lbs. I&rsquo;m not sure what I was thinking, but subconsciously I felt the bill was coming due. I had already set up an appointment with my General Practitioner for the day after my eye doctor. In hindsight I should have flipped those appointments around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are diabetic, or pre-diabetic.&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Your GP should confirm this. Oh and don&rsquo;t waste money on glasses just yet. The problem with your eyesight is probably just executes water and glucose swelling the lenses in your eyes. It&rsquo;s likely to clear up once you get the sugar under control. Ok?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And loose some weight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I walked home in a mental fog. When walked in the door I told my wife the news. She wasn&rsquo;t surprised and didn&rsquo;t hit me with the &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; routine. She was great. We knew this would mean big changes but the lifestyle modification (better diet/more exercise) wasn&rsquo;t a bad thing. Still I think I stayed home the rest of the day, sitting on my comfy chair, expecting to literally explode or something. It&rsquo;s funny. I had had periods of &ldquo;healthy living&rdquo; in my life but I had always fallen off that wagon. People always warned me this day would come. It was a wakeup call. Thankfully it wasn&rsquo;t in the form of a heart attack or something really debilitating. This diagnosis (or pre-diagnosis) seemed like a second chance.</p>

<p>The next day at the GP he checked my blood glucose which came in at a whopping 384. Normal blood glucose is around 100.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow. You are certainly diabetic. Most likely type 2.&rdquo;, he said raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need to get you on some meds&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fix this with diet and exercise?&rdquo;, I interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. With these numbers your body needs some help. Take this prescription get it filled and take it immediately. Test your glucose in the morning with this monitor I&rsquo;m giving you. If it doesn&rsquo;t go down tomorrow you may need to get to the hospital. It should go down, but call me either way when you test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took some blood for an Ha1c test. It&rsquo;s a test that yield a sort of 3 month average of blog glucose levels.</p>

<p>I had some questions. He took the time answered them all. Turns out, he is also diabetic. An insulin dependent type 2. He explained his trajectory through diabeties-space. I couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better doctor/coach for this phase of my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about alcohol?&rdquo;, I asked bracing myself for the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No booze for now. Especially on the medication I&rsquo;m prescribing now. Later, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had expected this. I figured that I&rsquo;d ask. I know there are diabetics out there that do drink, but I didn&rsquo;t want to deal with too many variables at once. Shutting down the drinking would be ok for now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best thing you can do right now: take your meds, watch your diet, and loose weight. It can be that simple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day, I tested. My blood glucose was 200. I called my doc. He was pleased. He told me it should continue to decrease but to call him if it didn&rsquo;t or if it got too low. No hospital visit for me. My Ha1c number was 14.7%. Not a great number. A non-diabetic person will have an Ha1c number between 4% and 6%.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how it began. I made some big life modifications that day. I bought some tools, started my exercise program, my diet, and started tracking my numbers. I also set a big goal. I wanted off the diabetes medication. I was going to turn my body and the disease around.</p>

			 <p>When the first plane hit we only noticed the lights flickering and the chirping of the power supplies attached to our computers. A few minutes later the phone calls started coming in from family. Something hit one of the trade center towers. I was on the phone with my wife listening to her telling me to leave the city and come home, when the second plane flew past our building and crashed into the second tower. This time we all heard the plane hit and we felt the blast.
I went out into the street to see what was happening. I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for what I saw. Both towers on fire, paper and other debris was raining down from the damaged floors above. My first instinct was to run to the site. I had friends there in those buildings and I wanted to lend a hand. My heart was pumping and I felt numb. The only thought in my head was to help. Get to the towers and help. People I passed were in shock. Some were crying. Sirens were screaming everywhere. A woman fainted her friends caught her. I didn&rsquo;t understand why, what did she see? When I got a block away from the south tower entrance I saw a police officer. He was directing traffic and people away from the area. I asked him where the people in the building who were evacuated being taken. He didn&rsquo;t know. I asked him how I can help. He couldn&rsquo;t say because he didn&rsquo;t know. I looked up and for the first time I saw people falling from the buildings. It was like time stopped. I had never seen anyone die before now I was watching, helpless, as many people were losing their lives violently at their own hands or in the fire raging 80 stories over my head.
At that instant I was enraged and impotent. I wasn&rsquo;t ready for this. There was something horrible happening that was out of control and no matter what I did there was nothing I could do to make things better. Then I looked back at the police officer and he said the best thing I could do would be to go home to my family. I walked/ran back to my building. I went back upstairs to the 7th floor. I called my wife to tell her I was safe and that I was going to try to make it to the Staten Island Ferry and leave the city from the south. I started to get off the phone with her when I heard her say, &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening&hellip;.&rdquo;. I felt our building shaking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming home. I&rsquo;ll be OK. I&rsquo;ll get in touch soon.&rdquo;, I told her just as the phones went dead and the power went out. I walked out into the hall.
I knew the elevators would be down so I made my way to the stairs. I opened the door to the stairway and it was pitch black. There were no emergency lights. Feeling my way down and trying to count the floors as I went, I started down from the seventh floor. As I got down to about what I had estimated to be the second floor, I met three other people who were making their way down. Thankfully they had flashlights. The doors weren&rsquo;t marked but we got to the bottom of the stairway and opened the door out to what we hoped would be the lobby. We stepped out into the room and it was still dark.
&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re in the basement?&rdquo;, one person said. I noticed the marble on the walls.
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;, I said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the lobby.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why is it so dark?, another person asked.
Then I heard someone shouting, &ldquo;Help us!&rdquo;. I spun around. Where was that coming from?
&ldquo;Help us!&rdquo;, I heard again.
This time someone came around a corner. It was a black woman. Maybe a police officer. I couldn&rsquo;t tell she was completely covered in dust. She was having difficulty breathing. It was in her eyes.
&ldquo;Water!&rdquo;, someone called behind her.There were people streaming in from the street.
They were also covered in dust.
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;, I asked.
Another police officer passed by and said, &ldquo;The tower fell.&rdquo;
Just then a janitor came from behind us in the hall way. The second officer asked him where we could get water. He fumbled for his keys and opened up one of the ground floor offices. There was a small kitchen in there. The few of us who were not choking were helping people into the kitchen, getting their eyes and throats clear, and helping the people who were coming in from the street. A person in a wheelchair, a woman with a baby, a British film crew. When things stabilized I opened an office door that faced West Street. I looked out the window and saw the entire street, as far as I could see covered with grey dust. A few people were stumbling, half/running, down the street. I banged on the window trying to signal them to go to the front of our building. Someone walked in to the office with a handheld camera. He was looking at the video he shot only moments ago as the tower collapsed. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes. By then people were talking about this as an attack. Quick rumors were circulating about more planes in the air. Someone said the Pentagon had been hit and the White House. As I turned away from the video and walked back to the window a police officer burst into the office and shouted,&ldquo;Everyone away from the windows! The second one is coming down!&rdquo;
We all ran out of the office and back into the hall. I felt a shudder, like a small earthquake. When it stopped I ran back to the office and looked out the window. I couldn&rsquo;t see anything. Just brown/grey dust blocking out the sun. I decided as soon as this dust settled enough that I would try to make it to the ferry. I walked back to the office with the kitchen. I grabbed an empty water bottle, filled it from the tap, and put it into my bag. I found some coffee filters and wet them down. They would do as dust masks if the dust didn&rsquo;t clear completely.I walked to the lobby entrance. The dust still choked the streets and I could almost make out the trees in Battery Park only a hundred feet away. Someone had a radio and was listening to the confused reporting in those first few hours. The Pentagon had been hit but not the White House. There were still planes unaccounted for but no other buildings have been hit. It was definitely a terrorist attack. Cell phones were useless. No one could make any calls. Someone walked outside to smoke a cigarette. They walked outside into that terrible cloud to smoke.
A few minutes later the dust settled some more. I decided to leave. I walked outside. There were no sirens I could hear. It was strangely quiet. I walked down into Battery Park. A merciful wind was keeping the western side of the park closest to the the water free from smoke. People were congregating into this small oasis of clean air. A police officer announced that they were going to try to evacuate people from this area by boat. The injured would go first. So I decided to wait. As I was waiting my cell phone rang. It was a colleague. She asked if I was OK. I told her I was fine and if she could call my wife to let her know where I was and that I was safe. She said she would and we hung up. I tried to make an outbound call but I couldn&rsquo;t get a signal. At least my wife would know I was safe. I waited a few more minutes and tried the phone again. This time I got though to my home. I told my wife my situation and bits and pieces of what happened. I told her how I was getting out. I told her I loved her. People from the crowd started asking me to use my phone. I was afraid if I hung up I wouldn&rsquo;t get another signal so I asked people to give me their names and the phone numbers they wanted to call. I relayed them to my wife and we got messages to about a dozen families, including two NYC Firemen who had just escaped the tower&rsquo;s collapse.Finally some tug boats pulled up to the seawall. One by one they loaded up people who were waiting in Battery Park and they took us over to Liberty State Park in New Jersey. During the short ride across the bay no one spoke. We all just looked back in horror and grief at the spot where the World Trade Center had been standing and was now burning ash.</p>

<blockquote>An unemployed worker in a breadline in 1932 would have felt little gratitude to the Rockefellers or the Mellons. But that is not the case in the present economic crisis. After a riot of unbridled greed such as the world has not seen since the conquistadors&rsquo; looting expeditions and after an unprecedented broad and rapid transfer of wealth upward by Wall Street and its corporate satellites, where is the popular anger directed, at least as depicted in the media? At &ldquo;Washington spending&rdquo; - which has increased primarily to provide unemployment compensation, food stamps and Medicaid to those economically damaged by the previous decade&rsquo;s corporate saturnalia.</blockquote>

			 <p>From the looks of the cascading Chrome logos being projected up front, today&rsquo;s keynote is likely to be all about the Chrome browser, and my least favorite Google project, Chrome OS.</p>

<p>Vic Gundrota back up on stage today. 600k viewers getting access to the various live streams.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s keynote will be about the platform none of us owns: the open web.</p>

<p>The stats: 160 million active Chrome browser users today.</p>

<p>Lot of work went into making chrome work well on Mac and Linux, they have also moved to a 6 week dev cycle. Lots of security and performance gains being made. The good news is that all modern browsers are aggressively implementing HTML 5.</p>

<p>Speech. Demoing adding speech API with one line of HTML 5. Great demo. Speech recognition for search worked flawlessly. Also demoed speech translation</p>

<p>JavaScript performance is good and potentially good enough for most applications. Wonder why this is downplayed.</p>

<p>2D canvas performance can leverage GPU support and it works well. Web GL also shows great performance gains for web graphics. HTML 5 apps are going to be getting better. Which makes me wonder why Google is propping up Flash.</p>

<p>Chrome Web Store in now going global. It&rsquo;s being translated in 41 languages. In app payments will also be available. In app payments can be integrated with very little code. In app purchases will cost publishers 5%. That&rsquo;s a lot lower than 30%.</p>

<p>Angry Birds publisher is showing off Angry Birds for the web. All HTML 5 Web GL and Canvas with hardware acceleration. It gets 60fps on most modern platforms and with browser client side storage you can play offline. They built some Chome specific levels. When in app purchases go live the Mighty Eagle will be available in Chrome. Previously only available only on iOS. The whole app is hosted on App Engine.</p>

<p>Arron Koblin showing off a new music project on the web. The demo and music are fantastic. It&rsquo;s like being immersed in a 3d animation. Amazing. It has a mine craft like build environment  so you can contribute to the project.  Uses the 3.js library. Very nice demo of the state of web graphics.</p>

<p>Of course with all this capable on the web why do we need an OS? Enter Chrome OS and the Chrome Book. Sounds like the next generation of the cr-48. Lots of improvements: better hardware and firmware. Demoing file management using PDFs, music, video, and photos via the new Chrome OS file manager. Including importing photos from an SD card right into Picasa. Great integration which is available via an API to all Chrome OS developers.</p>

<p>Disconnected access will also be improved. GDocs, gmail, and calendar will use these features.</p>

<p>Chrome books will be built by many vendors. Samsung, Acer but man are they ugly. These devices will cost about 300-500 USD and will be available shortly from Amazon across the world. Available June 15th.</p>

<p>Of course this type of device plays well in the enterprise. As most apps become web based why do we need computers with full OS stacks. 50k companies applied to test the cr-48. Google surveyed these companies and they reported that 75% of there users could switch to a Chrome Book. Google has created a web console to manage Chrome Books in the enterprise. A fuul hardware and software system for 28USD per user per month. Wow. 20 USD for schools and government. Also available June 15th. This is pretty nice. It&rsquo;s the future. Maybe I was wrong about Chrome OS?</p>

<p>Looks like everyone here is getting a free Chrome Book on June 15th.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of Google Music seemed pretty sedate. I think being sandwiched between Amazon&rsquo;s Cloud Storage announcement last month and the impending Apple cloud announcement is bad for Google. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. This is a good first step for Google but Music is basically not that much different than most music locker services. It requires you to upload your catalog (that would tie me a while since I have about 16 gigs of music), you can stream it to any device, and you can cache tracks on your devices for those long plane rides. They did add a &ldquo;genius&rdquo; mix feature but that&rsquo;s not very exciting. So overall I think this will be great for existing Android users but not a killer feature that entices people to choose Android over iOS.
I believe Apples offering will likely be simpler to use (I believe you won&rsquo;t have to upload anything to get tracks into the cloud) and it will have all iTunes features with maybe some interesting extras. We will have to wait for that shoe to drop. It should be more than a music locker. Simpler is better and I believe that in the consumer space simpler trumps open for most users.
Things are improving in the Android space, but they have a long way to go.</p>

			 <p>Huge crowd, heard the attendance was 5.5k give or take. There was a veritable geek stampede getting into the room this morning. Not sure if there is any big news that hasn&rsquo;t already been leaked. The Google music service launch, growth in Android market share, and possibly some more info on Honeycomb. It&rsquo;s all going down in about 12 minutes.</p>

<p>Vic Gundrota upon stage. His review of past IO conferences ends with a shot at Apple. (You stay classy, Vic.)</p>

<p>Hugo Barra kicks off the Android keynote. Review of the Android numbers. Still focused on activations which is the wrong stat. 210 available devices (mostly phones) is still impressive and 200k app in the Android app store. A healthy market, no doubt.</p>

<p>Two new services being announced today. One must be the music locker.</p>

<p>3.1 Honeycomb being released today. Good stuff in the update: resizable widgets, better USB support, and more. 3.1 will also be available on Google TV.</p>

<p>Next release, Ice cream sandwich, in the 4th quarter. The top priority will be device choice but it looks like the OS will become more homogeneous. Like iOs. Unlike iOS some of it will be open source.</p>

<p>Cool head tracking demo using the device camera to adjust an Open GL scene.</p>

<p>Android market now adding movie rentals. Terms are similar to other online rental outlets like iTunes. You can stream and &ldquo;pin&rdquo; a movie to a device which downloads it for playing movies on planes. No tethering to a computer to pin the content. So music must be next.</p>

<p>Music beta. All in the cloud. Uses a client app to move files up to Google&rsquo;s servers. So far it looks like Amazon&rsquo;s Cloud Drive. Looks like they have a &ldquo;Genius Mix&rdquo; feature like iTunes.  All demos are showing off both phone and tablets. Of course no tethering required. The service launches today in beta. It&rsquo;s free while it&rsquo;s in beta.</p>

<p>Barra announces an industry group that will govern how updates will happen to Android mobile devices. Should help speed the rate of Android updates.</p>

<p>Android Open Accessory is a new open standard and API for device interconnect. Demoing using an Android device with an exercise bike. Interesting idea. It&rsquo;s a hardware and software solution based on Arduino. (wow) this looks like a great program for building Hardware that interfaces with Android devices.</p>

<p>Android at Home is an extension of this idea but they are short on details on the hardware and software that drives the simple X10-like lighting demos. Still pretty new. Not available.</p>

<p>Looks like Google and Samsung are giving us all Galaxy Tab 10.1! Thanks! Nice way to wrap up the keynote!</p>

			 <p>There was a lot of talk on the Interwebs about baked vs non-baked blogging platforms. To summarize, a &ldquo;baked&rdquo; blogging system renders all content to static HTML and moves that content to a plain old HTTP server.  The alternative is to have a blogging system that renders a dynamic page for every request.  The advantages of the former is that nothing serves up faster than static HTML files.  It will keep you site from getting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">slashdotted</a> (does that still happen?), <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">fireballed</a>, etc. if you happen to write something interesting that people want to read.
My original blog, <a href="http://giolist.com">giolist.com</a> was for the longest time a statically hosted site before Google eliminated publishing static HTML using sftp from Blogger. The closest I came to a meltdown was a while ago when I posted <a href="http://urblog.giolist.com/2005/05/scott-n-stevehappy-together.html">something</a> that <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> liked and linked to from scripting.com.  Of course because it was all static HTML my site never went down even though it was hosted on a puny Linux box running Apache.  This incarnation of my blog is hosted on <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> and I&rsquo;m not sure it would handle the traffic if I were to come up with something <a href="http://www.catspictures.net/2009/05/hover-cat-pictures.html">profound</a>. I find myself wanting to go back to a &ldquo;baked&rdquo; system partly because of the scalability factor but also because of the simplicity.  Using static HTML doesn&rsquo;t preclude interaction or other dynamic elements. You can still do interesting things with JavaScript includes like twitter badges, or photo streams in the margins of your site, and of course <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> is more than happy to host your comments if you want them.
I&rsquo;ve been looking a lot at systems like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a> but I&rsquo;ve also been looking at rolling my own blogging system again. A short list of requirements would include:
<ul><br />
    <li>
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> support</li>
    <li>no database, all posts are generated from files</li>
    <li>no server-side CGI required or exposed to the Internet</li>
    <li>plugin API</li>
    <li>functional but not overly complex templating system</li>
        <li>post on the go from an iOS device</li>
    <li>
<a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> integration (although if your file based I think you get this for free)</li>
</ul>
It&rsquo;s an interesting project I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a lot lately. It might just use one of the open source projects as a base, since it&rsquo;s easier to add some of the features to an existing system than starting from scratch building everything.  The templating engine could be a pain and there are lots of good ones out there in many languages. I wrote one ages ago in Perl.  I&rsquo;m not sure I want to do that again. The idea of writing my own system seems right.  Now if I can only find the time. <em><em>sigh</em></em></p>

A tablet probably can&rsquo;t be successful without the kind of support ecosystem and the seamless integration between hardware and software that Apple can provide.

			 <p>About a week ago my family was gathered in the kitchen &ndash; all of us &ndash; a rare thing these days what with the kids growing up and all. We were talking about the coming new year and suddenly it dawned on me that when I was their age I thought that by now I&rsquo;d be living in outer space.  I explained that I thought I&rsquo;d be shuttling back and forth between the Earth, Moon, and Mars, repairing computer systems, visiting friends and family, and generally cavorting in zero G. At first they all looked at me like I had suddenly sprouted another head.  That was before they burst out into raucous laughter. I was puzzled by their reaction. They thought it was the most ridiculous thing they had ever heard. I didn&rsquo;t probe as to where they thought they&rsquo;d be in 10 or 20 years but I think their dreams are much more down to earth.<br />
That makes me sad. Then again when I was a kid human space exploration was a big deal. The Apollo program, Skylab, Voyager, Viking were all big milestones for mankind. Today space exploration so mundane it hardly gets a mention on the news. It&rsquo;s all but disappeared from the public consciousness, so much so that kids don&rsquo;t dream of being astronauts.
So today when we sit down to our New Year&rsquo;s dinner I plan on asking the kids what they think their future holds. I&rsquo;m curious what they will say. They are my time machine. They are going to see how this life, this movie, is going to turn out &ndash; at least the one I&rsquo;m living in. I wonder how they think it&rsquo;s going to end.</p>

			 <p>A lot of people have been asking me if I will switch when the iPhone is available on the Verizon Wireless network. The short answer: Probably not. Here is my thinking.
First, I&rsquo;m assuming there is a huge pent-up demand for the iPhone on Verizon.  That will consist of existing Verizon customer and a slew of disgruntled AT&amp;T customers who have been itching to switch because of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s less than stellar network.  This is going to mean a ton of new subscribers hitting the Verizon network with data hungry iPhones.  I have a feeling Verizon&rsquo;s cellular network will bend and probably break under the strain. So the Verizon network might get worse for the first few quarters while it&rsquo;s under rapid expansion of subscribers and the load on the network increases.  There hasn&rsquo;t been a CDMA version of the iPhone so we are not sure how it will behave on that network. The result may be a poor network experience for all those new switchers.
Second, I have to buy a new phone. My existing iPhone won&rsquo;t work on the Verizon network so I&rsquo;ll have to buy a new phone and new plan with Verizon.  Which means I&rsquo;ll have to cover two plans at once.  Just to switch to Verizon. Not terrible but not ideal.
Finally, I remember all the issues that AT&amp;T had with activations when they first launched the iPhone a few years ago.  We don&rsquo;t know the details but there were a lot of processes between Apple and AT&amp;T that weren&rsquo;t fully baked and tested.  The first few months were a bit rough for users with activation problems.  Apple can certainly bring a ton of experience to bear but Verizon is new to the iPhone. I anticipate glitches in the Apple/Verizon backend system integration that might cause issues for new switchers.
So I&rsquo;m going to uncharacteristically sit on the sidelines for this launch. I have been happier with AT&amp;T service over the past 6 months.  It seems to be getting better, although I haven&rsquo;t traveled to Mountain View lately.  It&rsquo;s been working very well in the NYC Metro area. Who knows.  Maybe all those folks fleeing AT&amp;T just might give us some more bandwidth and improve quality of service for those of us left behind on AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never used <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> but I&rsquo;ve always known it to be the premier solution for hosting Ruby apps in the cloud. The acquisition by Salesforce.com is interesting from the standpoint that Sf.com cloud app solutions have been primarily Java based. I think their broadening their strategy, and potential user-base, by opening up to more languages.  Java dominates the enterprise (Yes, I know that&rsquo;s a dirty word in the Ruby community.) application space which is traditional ground for Sf.com. Presumably, <a href="http://www.vmforce.com/">vmforce</a>, Sf.com&rsquo;s Java cloud app solution will service the bulk of their customers. I don&rsquo;t see how they can simply merge the two services but it will be interesting to watch this evolve.</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/heroku-ceo-talks-about-salesforce-future/">Heroku CEO Talks About Salesforce, Future</a> via <a href="http://gigaom.com">GigaOM</a></p>

<p>Heroku apparently has over 100,000 apps hosted.  That&rsquo;s damn impressive if they aren&rsquo;t loosing money on every customer. According to the Heroku CEO, Sf.com want them to &ldquo;keep doing their thing&rdquo;, which should soothe the fears of those using the service. So that indicates that Sf.com will be providing a &ldquo;right cloud for the right job&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;one cloud to rull them all&rdquo; approach. Possibly better for users but less efficient for Sf.com to run multiple businesses using different technologies.</p>

<p>The more I think about WikiLeaks the more convinced I become that this is an organization trying to do good. I believe that in releasing the Iraqi War Papers or the latest dump of State Department Cables Wikileaks is shedding light into the inner workings of our own government.  While I do believe there is need for secrecy and confidentiality in many government operations I believe this capability is given by mandate of the people.  If the government is operating counter to the will, or in a way detrimental to the well-being of the people, this capability can and should be taken away.  The government operating in secrecy, without proper oversight, and accountability to the people becomes a government that is prone to wrong-doing, deceit, and in severe cases treason. When the government operates this way its every citizens duty to repeal the mandate of power by means granted to us in the constitution. That includes whistle-blowing and leaking information to the press.
Whistle-blowing helped bring an end to the Viet-nam War, the corrupt Nixon administration, and were instrumental in breaking down the power of tobacco companies. So how different is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg">Daniel Ellsberg</a> leaking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers">Pentagon Papers</a> to the New York Times from someone in the military leaking the Iraq War papers to Julian Assange? Not much if you think about it.</p>

			 <p>Like a lot of gamers out there I&rsquo;ve been logging my fair share of hours (and kills) in Treyarch&rsquo;s Call of Duty: Black Ops. You know, the game that recently grossed about 650 million the weekend it was released? The game where you join in hours of endless, deadly, pretend combat, in savage team death matches. Yeah, that one.
You can imagine how fascinated I was when I came across the article <a href="http://sidemission.com/index.php/moral-relativism-in-a-black-ops-world-and-being-better-humans">Moral Relativism in a Black Ops World, and being better humans</a> by Jeffrey MacCormack.  The first half of the article read like criticism of the typical players behavior in multiplayer online combat. I think most people would be somewhat shocked by the behavior of some of my in-game compadres.  I mean how do you explain to a normal person that your opponent is heaping on generous helpings of humiliation on you by pretending to tea-bag your now bullet riddled body? Kind of hard to wrap your mind around if you don&rsquo;t play, but the second half of the article is a bit more interesting.
MacCormack suggests that all the attention Call of Duty (CoD) is garnering these days may be co-opted to change the real world for the better.  What&rsquo;s the cause he wants my fellow couch-bound war fighters to tackle? Child soldiers. More specifically, helping to reduce the types of weapons that make child soldiers even possible.
I had never considered that it wouldn&rsquo;t really be impractical to use a child as a soldier without a weapon that a small person could fire. It turns out that small machine guns (SMGs) are the weapon of choice dictators and warlords use to equip these poor children and they are pretty common in CoD.  MacCormack would like CoD players to contact Treyarch support and ask them to remove SMGs from the next version of CoD.  An in game embargo won&rsquo;t change the real world situation but it might draw big media attention to the problem. I would suggest that even a half step might help. Just ban the use of SMGs in the game for a week. I know a lot of players would bitch about that but it would be for a good cause. It might just cause a minor media frenzy. I can visualize Wolf Blitzer covering the story on the Situation Room.
It&rsquo;s a great article. Read it and if you feel so inclined, take action.</p>

			 <p>Going Google has now become a possibility for the individual. Google is in the early stages of making more of there services available to Google Apps accounts holders.  That means the differences between a standard Google account and a Google Apps account are being erased.  In the past services like Google Analytics, Adwords, Blogger, and Picasa could not be used by Google Apps account holders. If you wanted to use those services you had to use a standard, personal, Google Account. This makes the decision to create a Google Apps account for a &ldquo;prosumer&rdquo; a no brainer.  Why sign up for a personal account with a generic &lsquo;@gmail.com&rsquo; address when you can sign up for a Google Apps account with your own personal domain? It certainly boosts the stock value of a Google Apps account.</p>

			 <p>Over the long weekend my three year old Canon printer gave up the ghost. Some kind of power supply problem. Normally I would be upset but the event simply gave me a perfect excuse to buy a new printer. Since I recently updated all my iOS devices to 4.2, that new printer would be one that supports ePrint which would let me print from my recently updated iPhone or iPad.
I found the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4356">iOS: AirPrint 101</a> doc from Apple very helpful.  It told me <em>exactly</em> what printers supported AirPrint. Be forewarned. Not all ePrint compatible printers support AirPrint. Stick to the list supplied by Apple. I settled on the <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF05a/18972-18972-238444-421635-410635-4021933.html">HP PHOTOSMART PLUS e-All-IN-ONE B210</a>. It not only supported ePrint but wifi, decent photo printing, and scanning. It&rsquo;s perfect for a home printer.
Configuring the printer hardware took about 5 minutes. Nothing out of the ordinary. The printer chugged along, cycling through diagnostics, finally prompting me to configure the wireless connection. Once that was complete, the printer emitted a diagnostic page with some information about the ePrint setup. (More about this below.) On each of my Mac OS X machines I installed the drivers, added the printer, and printed a test page or two. Each worked fine.
There is nothing to install on your iOS devices to take advantage of AirPrint. You just need to update to iOS 4.2 and AirPrint should just work. I used the aforementioned AirPrint 101 doc as a guide. My tests with the standar apps (Mail and Safari) were fine and went as advertised. I was also able to view the print queue right from my iOS device by double pressing the home button and tapping on the AirPrint &ldquo;app&rdquo; running in the multitasking area of the iPhone and iPad. Everything just worked. The only disappointing bit was printing from Pages. That didn&rsquo;t work or at least there was no print button off the share button. I also tried Numbers and Keynote. No joy there as well. I have updated the apps recently so I&rsquo;m not sure when these apps will have the print button. I would think Apple would have included this in the last update.
There is a workaround for apps that don&rsquo;t have the print button. The ePrint configuration on the HP printer creates a special, Internet accessible, email address. It looks something like <code>asdf123asdf@hpeprint.com</code>. If you email documents to that email address it will print on your printer.  It&rsquo;s a great feature but you need to make sure you lock down just what email addresses can send to your printer. Anyone that knows the email address can print to your ePrint printer. As a safety measure, HP allows you to restrict what email addresses can send jobs to the printer. This setup is pretty simple and the instructions are printed on that first page the printer prints at the end of the hardware setup. I tested this from Numbers and it worked fine. A bit annoying but it&rsquo;s functional.
Overall I&rsquo;m quite happy with AirPrint so far.  The HP printer works great.  Apps that support Airprint work flawlessly. While I&rsquo;m waiting for the rest of the apps I care to print from to support it, I can use the standard ePrint via email. But like all things iOS this is just going to get better as time passes. Pretty magical, eh?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When most people who don&rsquo;t use <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> (let&rsquo;s call them &ldquo;normals&rdquo;) find out I have a Twitter account they always ask, &ldquo;What do you use it for?&rdquo;. Most of the information here is meant for &ldquo;normals&rdquo;.  The twitterati will find most of this information old hat.
Twitter is a feed of information from friends or other people/services I find interesting.  I scan this feed for anything that I may find useful</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fraying/status/29642714603">twitter.com</a></p>

<p>or amusing.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hotdogsladies/status/2211838641">twitter.com</a></p>

<p>Because the information is usually &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; Twitter is a great way to keep on top of things that are happening now.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nytimes/status/8969279219171328">twitter.com</a></p>

<p>The half-life of a &ldquo;tweet&rdquo; is usually pretty small. That last tweet above is probably terribly old but at the time I wrote this post it was hot.  Tweets are the freshest of fresh news and like fresh mozzarella it&rsquo;s best consumed ASAP before it gets hard and dry.  The quality of the tweets in your Twitter feed is going to be directly proportional to the quality of the people you follow in Twitter.  The people I follow come from many backgrounds from technology, news, and the arts.  I also subscribe to friends and other acquaintances because sometimes Twitter is the best place to get real-time updates on what&rsquo;s happening with them.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kimandy/status/7250332287508480">twitter.com</a></p>

<p>No matter where they are in the world. Twitter is an amazing tool.
You can read tweets right at <a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a> but most people use a Twitter client on their desktop. I happen to use <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> on my Mac. Twitter is also great on mobile devices since you can read and post right from the palm of your hand when you are on the go.  I use the official <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/twitter-for-iphone.html">Twitter</a> client on my iPhone when I&rsquo;m on the road or just standing in line somewhere.  There are a lot of Twitter clients out there. You should try out a bunch and use the one that&rsquo;s right for you.
Twitter is read/write. So besides consuming the information in my Twitter feed I post often.  I try to post things that people may find interesting.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stevegio/status/25973671584">twitter.com</a></p>

<p>Sometimes my posts are just what I&rsquo;m doing or where I happen to be at the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stevegio/status/8192562116435969">twitter.com</a></p>

<p>Other times its just for fun.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/stevegio/status/8307380014030848">twitter.com</a></p>

<p>That last tweet, besides containing an embedded link to a photo, shows off how Twitter is integrated to other applications. Twitter is everywhere and can be integrated into all kinds of sites and tools.  My tweets are automatically sent to Facebook.
Twitter is remarkable but like all tools born of the Internet you have to spend some time working with it before you&rsquo;ll get any utility out of it.  There is no wrong way to use Twitter although if you post too much nonsense you may find your posts ignored and yourself very lonely.  The worst thing you can do is ignore it before you&rsquo;ve given it a decent test drive. So do some research and give it a go.</p>

			 <p>I fly a lot. It&rsquo;s an occupational necessity. When the TSA was first introduced after 9/11 I though it was a good idea to have stepped up and consistent security procedures at our airports. So after years of dealing with the TSA, I believe we now have a system that is clearly out of control.
We have all heard the TSA horror stories.  At first they were few and far between but now it seems like I hear of these transgressions on a weekly basis. The latest incident at <a href="http://johnnyedge.blogspot.com/2010/11/these-events-took-place-roughly-between.html">San Diego International Airport</a> I find particularly distasteful and alarming.  Full body scanners? Invasive unwarranted search?  What&rsquo;s next?
The body scanners the TSA wants to deploy are slow, potentially harmful (especially for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/11/16/travel.airport.security.measures/index.html">frequent flyers</a>), and a violation of our rights. The TSA and other agencies say they can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t store those images, but there are <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40218074/ns/technology_and_science-security">no guarantees</a> those scanner images won&rsquo;t turn up on the Internet.
It&rsquo;s time to stop this madness. Start at <a href="http://flywithdignity.org/">Fly with Dignity</a>. Get involved. Get educated.  Then call you senator and congress person and ask them to take action.  It only takes a few minutes to register a policy concern and it does have an effect. I had an hour of my live back when a customer cancelled a conference call so I called my senators and my congressman. I was done in 15 minutes and that includes contacting my state legislators. Here in NJ we have a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/travel/sns-ap-us-travel-brief-nj-scanners-lawmakers,0,6503537.story">local resolution</a> to send a signal to legislators at the national level to stop the deployment of these body scanners in our airports.
There has got to be a better way. Stepping up questioning at airports is probably a better idea.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m up too late but I don&rsquo;t have much to do tomorrow.  I&rsquo;ll be riding jet plane east; home-ward bound. What&rsquo;s keeping me up is the download.  I bought the Beatles complete catalog on iTunes and since I&rsquo;m on the road connected to the Internet via a slow hotel link, this is taking longer than I&rsquo;d like.  I&rsquo;m playing them as they download. They are coming in chronological &ldquo;release date&rdquo; order. I&rsquo;m only at &ldquo;Hard Day&rsquo;s Night&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;ve owned this music in different forms vinyl, 8-track, cassette, and CDs. Those physical objects have been lost, sold, and some re-purchased as CDs and imported into my digital music library. Not all of it. I&rsquo;ve never had it all in one place or in one format until now. I was always too broke or too busy to gather every track and import it into my library. That&rsquo;s been remedied. One click and it&rsquo;s all over but the downloading. I&rsquo;m grateful Apple and Apple have been able to come to an agreement. It&rsquo;s made my life easier. This hasn&rsquo;t been a day I&rsquo;ll remember forever and it isn&rsquo;t a revolution. It should have happened long ago. That being said, one of my musical wishes has been granted today.
Since wishes normally come in threes, I have two more wishes to tempt the muses and the powers that be in the music business tonight.  The first is that the release of the Beatles on iTunes will expose more young kids to this music. Trust me kids. Listen to it. It&rsquo;s good for you. My second wish is that the Zappa family and Apple come together (no pun intended) to make the complete works of Frank Zappa available on iTunes.
Woohoo! Here comes Revolver! Good night folks.</p>
